# Binho Host Adapter Python Libraries

### Introduction

Cross-platform Python 3.x library for automated control of binho multi-protocol USB host adapters. More information about the hardware can be found at https://www.binho.io

### Dependencies

This library requires [pySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) for cross-platform access of the serial port. This library will be installed automatically by pip, however for easy reference, this can be manually installed simply by running the following command:
```
pip install pyserial
```

### Installation

This library can be installed easily with the following command:
```
pip install binho-host-adapter
```

### Example Usage

```python
from binhoHostAdapter import binhoHostAdapter
from binhoHostAdapter import binhoUtilities

print("Demo Script with Binho Host Adapter Python Libraries")
print

utilities = binhoUtilities.binhoUtilities()
devices = utilities.listAvailableDevices()

if len(devices) == 0:
	print("No Devices Found!")
	exit()

elif len(devices) == 1:
	COMPORT = devices[0]
	print("Found 1 attached adapter @ " + devices[0])
	print
else:
	COMPORT = devices[0]
	print("Found more than 1 attached adapter, using first device found on " + COMPORT)
	print

print("Opening " + COMPORT + "...")
print

# create the binhoHostAdapter object
binho = binhoHostAdapter.binhoHostAdapter(COMPORT)

print("Connecting to host adapter...")
print(binho.getDeviceID())
print
```
