Description: # Binho Host Adapter Python Libraries
        
        ### Introduction
        
        Cross-platform Python 3.x library for automated control of binho multi-protocol USB host adapters. More information about the hardware can be found at https://www.binho.io
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        This library requires [pySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) for cross-platform access of the serial port. This library will be installed automatically by pip, however for easy reference, this can be manually installed simply by running the following command:
        ```
        pip install pyserial
        ```
        
        ### Installation
        
        This library can be installed easily with the following command:
        ```
        pip install binho-host-adapter
        ```
        
        ### Example Usage
        
        ```python
        from binhoHostAdapter import binhoHostAdapter
        from binhoHostAdapter import binhoUtilities
        
        print("Demo Script with Binho Host Adapter Python Libraries")
        print
        
        utilities = binhoUtilities.binhoUtilities()
        devices = utilities.listAvailableDevices()
        
        if len(devices) == 0:
        	print("No Devices Found!")
        	exit()
        
        elif len(devices) == 1:
        	COMPORT = devices[0]
        	print("Found 1 attached adapter @ " + devices[0])
        	print
        else:
        	COMPORT = devices[0]
        	print("Found more than 1 attached adapter, using first device found on " + COMPORT)
        	print
        
        print("Opening " + COMPORT + "...")
        print
        
        # create the binhoHostAdapter object
        binho = binhoHostAdapter.binhoHostAdapter(COMPORT)
        
        print("Connecting to host adapter...")
        print(binho.getDeviceID())
        print
        ```
        ### Documentation
        
        The full set of documentation for this python library can be found at https://support.binho.io/python-libraries
        
        ### Releasing an updated package to PyPI
        
        Packaging and releasing a new build version for distribution can be acheived by following the procedure here:
        https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
        
        Be sure to increment the version in the `setup.py` file before building the distribution using the commands below.
        
        Dependencies for the packaging/distribution process can be installed with the following commands:
        
        ```
        pip install --upgrade setuptools
        pip install --upgrade wheel
        pip install --upgrade twine
        ```
        
        Building and releasing a package can be achieved with the following commands:
        ```
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        python -m twine upload dist/*
        ```
