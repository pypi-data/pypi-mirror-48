Description: # kts
        
        `kts` is the first competition-oriented framework for interactive feature engineering and building reproducible pipelines.
        
        ## Getting started
        
        To get the latest version of the framework, you can either use `pip` or download the source code via `git clone`:
        
        ``` sh
        $ pip3 install kts
        ```
        or
        ``` sh
        $ git clone github.com/konodyuk/kts.git
        ```
        
        The second option is better only if you want to download our example.
        
        After installation you need to initialize your kts project:
        
        ``` sh
        $ cd project/
        $ kts init
        ```
        
        We highly recommend that you use an empty folder for that, but if you want to use already downloaded data, ensure that it is stored in `project/input` and follow the instructions.
        
        ## Example
        
        To get used to kts interface, run the example notebook. It contains a full data processing cycle with kts. Of course, the example is not comprehensive, so don't hesitate to ask [me](https://telegram.me/konodyuk) any questions.
