# pitchplots

library plotting charts for different tonal representations

## Getting Started

The program consist in the following files: functions.py, reader.py, modified_musicxml_parser.py, parser.py and static.py 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You will need python on your computer and the following libaries: matplotlib, pandas and numpy
```

note that if you are using anaconda, these libraries are already installed

### Installing

You can download the pitchplots package on pypi with pip using the following command in the prompt:

```
python3 -m pip install pitchplots
```

or if you're using anaconda prompt

```
pip install pitchplots
```

## Running the tests

you can first try to parse xml/musicScore xml files to csv or DataFrame, that is the Gymnop√©die from Sati with:

```python
import pitchplots.parser as ppp

# If no filepath is specified, will automatically charge data_example.mxl
df_data_example = ppp.xml_to_csv(save_csv=True)
```

then you can try the static module by passing csv files or Dataframe:

```
import pitchplots.static as pps

pps.tonnetz(df_data_example)
```
or
```
import pitchplots.static as pps

pps.circle('csv/data_example.csv')
```

to try the dynamic videos:
```
import pitchplots.dynamic as ppd

ppd.tonnetz_animation(df_data_example)
```
