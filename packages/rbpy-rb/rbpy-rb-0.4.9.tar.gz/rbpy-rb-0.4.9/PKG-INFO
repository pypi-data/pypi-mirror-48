        ## Install
        1. `pip3 install --user rbpy-rb` (or clone this repo master branch)
        2. run `./install.sh`
        
        You may also need some spacy models which are downloaded through spacy.     
        You have to download these spacy models by yourself, using the command:    
        `python3 -m spacy download name_of_the_model`   
        The logger will also write instructions on which models you need, and how to download them.  
        
        ## Usage
        For usage (parsing, lemmatization, NER, wordnet, content words, indices etc.)  see file `usage.py`

        ## How to use the logger
        In each file you have to initialize the logger:  
        ```sh
        from rb.utils.rblogger import Logger  
        logger = Logger.get_logger() 
        logger.info("info msg")
        logger.warning("warning msg")  
        logger.error()
        ```
