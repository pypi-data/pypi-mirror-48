    Seismic data recorded by regional stations associated with the Crandall
    Canyon Mine Collapse (goo.gl/2ezyZD). Six mine workers and three rescue
    workers lost their lives in the disaster.

    This dataset is of interest to mine seismology researchers because better
    understanding of the conditions and sources involved will help prevent
    future disasters.

    I have personally modified and added some phase picks to the events.
    Without closer examination, this dataset should be used for testing
    and demonstration purposes only.
