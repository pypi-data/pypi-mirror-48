    The Bingham Canyon dataset includes waveforms recorded during and after
    the Manefay Slide, one of the largest anthropogenic landslides ever
    recorded (https://bit.ly/2bsRsyR).Fortunately, due to close monitoring,
    no one was injured.

    I have personally modified and added some phase picks to the events.
    Without closer examination, this dataset should be used for testing
    and demonstration purposes only.
