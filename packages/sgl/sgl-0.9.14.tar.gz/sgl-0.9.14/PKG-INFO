        # SGL (Simple Grant Language)
        
        SGL is a simple but flexible [DSL](
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for granting and
        testing privileges (authorization). You can use it to write rules about
        who should be able to do what, and then to compare circumstances to the
        rules to enforce custom logic. This lets you create your own [Role-Based
        Access Control]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
        mechanisms, as well as authorizations based on other criteria.
        
        For example, here's an SGL rule that says only members of the press
        should be allowed backstage at a concert:
        
        ```JSON
        {"grant": ["backstage"], "when": { "roles": "press" }}
        ```
        
        And here's how you might use that rule in code:
        
        ```python
        from sgl.api import satisfies
        
        my_rule = {"grant": ["backstage"], "when": { "roles": "press" }}
        
        people = [
            {"id": "Alex", "roles": ["ticket-holder"]},
            {"id": "Sofia", "roles": ["ticket-holder", "premium"]}
        ]
        
        for person in people:
            name = person['id']
            if satisfies(person, my_rule):
                print(f"Welcome backstage, {name}.")
            else:
                print(f"Sorry, this area is restricted, {name}.")
        ```
        
        If you ran this code, you'd see:
        
        ```bash
        $ python sample_code.py
        Sorry, this area is restricted, Alex.
        Welcome backstage, Sofia.
        ```
        
        SGL supports arbitrarily complex rules with boolean operators, as well
        as rules that require multiple people to jointly exercise a privilege.
        However, it's simple enough that you should be able to learn it in just
        a few minutes. See the [tutorial](
        https://dhh1128.github.io/sgl/docs/tutorial.html).
        
        >Note: SGL can be [rendered in various styles](
        https://dhh1128.github.io/sgl/docs/renderings.html). The example above
        uses the recommended JSON rendering, since JSON is familiar, broadly
        supported, and easy to read. Other possibilities include ProtoBuf,
        MsgPack, CBOR, and human-friendly text.
        
        SGL is not integrated with any particular enforcement mechanism, because
        it's designed for problems where you have to do your own enforcement.
        Hooking it up to enforcement mechanisms is trivial, though.
