        Orange Bioinformatics extends Orange, a data mining software
        package, with common functionality for bioinformatics. The provided
        functionality can be accessed as a Python library or through a visual
        programming interface (Orange Canvas). The latter is also suitable for
        non-programmers.
        
        In Orange Canvas the analyst connects basic computational units, called
        widgets, into data flow analytics schemas. Two units-widgets can be
        connected if they share a data type. Compared to other popular tools like
        Taverna, Orange widgets are high-level, integrated potentially complex
        tasks, but are specific enough to be used independently. Even elaborate
        analyses rarely consist of more than ten widgets; while tasks such as
        clustering and enrichment analysis could be executed with up to five
        widgets. While building the schema each widget is independently controlled
        with settings, the settings do not conceptually burden the analyst.
        
        Orange Bioinformatics provides access to publicly available data, like GEO data sets, GO and KEGG.
        All features can be combined with powerful visualization, network exploration and
        data mining techniques from the Orange data mining framework.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install the add-on with pip use
        
            pip install Orange3-bioinformatics
        
        To register this add-on with Orange, but keep the code in the development directory (do not copy it to
        Python's site-packages directory), run
        
            pip install -e .
        
        Documentation / widget help can be built by running
        
            make html htmlhelp
        
        from the doc directory.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After the installation, the widgets from this add-on are registered with Orange. To run Orange from the terminal, use
        
            python3 -m Orange.canvas
            
        or
        
            orange-canvas
        
        The new widgets are in the toolbox bar under Bioinformatics section.
