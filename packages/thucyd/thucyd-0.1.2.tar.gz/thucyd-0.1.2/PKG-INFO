        ## What is `thucyd`?
        
        `thucyd` (thoo'-sid) is an open-source library of Python-centric code that delivers implementations of eigenanalysis and causal filters that are not currently found elsewhere. 
        
        The first subpackage is `eigen`, and within this package a reference implementation of the algorithm for _a consistent basis for eigenanalysis_ is provided. This subpackage is ready. 
        
        Additional subpackages will include `filter_reference` and `filters`, with an expected rolling delivery through 2020.
        
        
        ## Package Installation
        
        The two package hosts for `thucyd` are [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/thucyd/) and [Conda-Forge](). The packages are identical and the only difference is the means of delivery. From PyPi, use `pip`,
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install thucyd
        ```
        
        and from Conda-Forge use `conda`:
        
        ```bash
        $ conda install -c conda-forge thucyd
        ```
        
        Once installed, the package is importable to Python:
        
        ```python
        >>> import thucyd
        ```
        
        **Note: At this time the conda-forge package is not yet available.**
        
        A quick example call to the `eigen` subpackage would be
        
        ```python
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> Vor, Eor, signs, _, _ = thucyd.eigen.orient_eigenvectors(np.eye(3).dot(np.diag([1., -1., 1.])), np.diag(np.arange(3)[::-1]))
        >>> Vor
        array([[1., 0., 0.],
               [0., 1., 0.],
               [0., 0., 1.]])
        >>> signs
        array([ 1., -1.,  1.])
        ```
        
        
        ## Package Dependency
        
        The only dependencies `thucyd` has at this time is on [python >= 3.7](https://www.python.org/) and [numpy >= 1.14](https://www.numpy.org/). 
        
        
        ## Why `thucyd`
        
        [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) was the first Western writer and historian who applied scientific principles to the recording of Western history. Although Herodotus, who predates Thucydides by less than a generation, started the transformation away from the epic poetry enshrined by Homer to a more objective record, it was Thucydides who engaged in inquiry and cross validation of all accounts in his History of the Peloponnesian Wars.
        
        The `thucyd` package honors the great historian by delivering implementations of eigenanalysis and signal-processing analytics that have been thoroughly researched and validated, and continues the tradition of inquiry by focusing on all the ways that rigorous eigen- and signal-processing theories can be applied to the financial markets and other machine-learning disciplines.
