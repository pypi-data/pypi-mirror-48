        Various web scraping and data science related tools. 
        
        Provides commonly used tools for web scraping and data science. Some of these tools might be superfluous. But the 
        purpose is to provide them through import, rather than requiring a separate file to go with a jupyter notebook, to allow 
        for more elegant project structure (ideally only the notebook).
