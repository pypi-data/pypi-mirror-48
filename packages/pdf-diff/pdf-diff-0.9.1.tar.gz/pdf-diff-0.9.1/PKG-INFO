Description: # pdf-diff
        
        Finds differences between two PDF documents:
        
        1. Compares the text layers of two PDF documents and outputs the bounding boxes of changed text in JSON.
        2. Rasterizes the changed pages in the PDFs to a PNG and draws red outlines around changed text.

        The script is written in Python 3, and it relies on the `pdftotext` program.
