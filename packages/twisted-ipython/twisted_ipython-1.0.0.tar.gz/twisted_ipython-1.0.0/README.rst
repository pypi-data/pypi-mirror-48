twisted_ipython
===============

An `IPython <https://ipython.org/>`__ extension that uses
`crochet <https://github.com/itamarst/crochet>`__ to enable running
`Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/>`__ in IPython and
`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__ notebooks.

The Problem
-----------

Traditionally, the IPython REPL has only truly supported synchronous
code. However, IPython `shipped support for running
coroutines <https://blog.jupyter.org/ipython-7-0-async-repl-a35ce050f7f7>`__
late last year with support for
`asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`__,
`curio <https://github.com/dabeaz/curio>`__ and
`trio <https://github.com/python-trio/trio>`__, which is really cool!
Unfortunately, it has some limitations.

In particular, code deemed to be running in an async format is ran by
`taking a paused/not-running event loop, running it long enough to
execute the async code, and then pausing the
loop <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/async_helpers.py#L28>`__.
This isn’t an unreasonable implementation given that IPython was (as far
as I know) not originally factored to run async code at all. It does,
however, put us in a bind, because if you try to start the Twisted event
loop a second time it will `yell at you and
refuse <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/8d18e4f83105822a6bad3698eb41ff2f35d56042/src/twisted/internet/error.py#L419>`__.
This is because in a typical application an event loop is kept running
throughout the lifetime of that process.

A Partial Solution
------------------

`Crochet <https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ is a library
that runs the Twisted reactor in a thread. This is handy, because our
runner implementation ends up being a call to
```ensureDeferred`` <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred.html>`__
wrapped in the
```wait_for`` <https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#wait-for-blocking-calls-into-twisted>`__
decorator. This means that we can `set
up <https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#setup>`__ Crochet
on extension initialiation, register a small runner to the autoawait
magic, and have ``%autoawait`` support for twisted. In addition, because
the loop continues to run in the background, backgrounded tasks will
still run once the cell is finished executing. Great!

Loading the module and setting up Twisted autoawait once installed looks
like this:

.. code:: ipython3

    %load_ext twisted_ipython
    %autoawait twisted

From there we can define a few helpers for our demo:

.. code:: ipython3

    from twisted.internet import reactor
    from twisted.internet.defer import Deferred
    
    
    # A little helper for demo-ing awaiting and Deferreds
    def sleep(t):
        d = Deferred()
        reactor.callLater(t, d.callback, None)
        return d
      
      
    # A little helper for demo-ing working display
    class Shout:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value
        def _repr_markdown_(self):
            return f'# {self.value}'

and **Check it out: ``autoawait`` Just Works:**

.. code:: ipython3

    print('Going to sleep...')
    
    await sleep(1)
    
    Shout('I HAVE AWAKENED!')


.. parsed-literal::

    Going to sleep...




I HAVE AWAKENED!
================



Running Non-Awaiting Code With ``crochet.run_in_reactor``
---------------------------------------------------------

In addition to being able to run code with ``await``\ ed results in it,
it would be nice if we could also safely run Twisted code that interacts
with the reactor but *doesn’t* use async/await.

Crochet ships with a helper called
```run_in_reactor`` <https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#run-in-reactor-asynchronous-results>`__
which can decorate wrapper functions so that they can safely interact
with the reactor.

I support this with a code magic, ``%%run_in_reactor``. What this magic
does is a little scary: It intercepts the python code in the cell as
text, detects its indentation level, and generates new python code (as
text) that wraps the cell in a decorated function. In addition, it
allows for taking the end result of a wrapped block (which must use the
``return`` keyword unlike regular cells) and making the crochet
``EventualResult`` object available in the namespace. This makes it
possible to interact with eventual results without using async/await.

Using the magic with this feature looks like this:

.. code:: ipython3

    %%run_in_reactor result
    
    # This runs this non-awaiting code in the correct thread
    # and allows access to the returned value via crochet's
    # EventualResult
    
    d = sleep(1)
    
    d.addCallback(lambda _: Shout('We did it!'))
    
    return d




.. parsed-literal::

    <crochet._eventloop.EventualResult at 0x7fe460d72d68>



.. code:: ipython3

    # and we can access that result!
    
    result.wait(2)




We did it!
==========



Install
-------

This library is `available on
pypi <https://pypi.org/project/twisted_ipython/>`__ and can be installed
into your notebook’s environment using
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__. For a more concrete example
using `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__, check out the
developer docs below.

Configuration
=============

As of now, ``twisted_ipython`` has one configuration option:

-  **timeout**: The timeout, in seconds, used for calls to ``wait_for``
   when autoawaiting

You can set the configuration using the ``%crochet_config`` magic:

.. code:: ipython3

    %crochet_config show
    %crochet_config timeout 1


.. parsed-literal::

    # Crochet settings:
     - timeout=60
    Setting timeout to 1!


.. code:: ipython3

    await sleep(2)

“Wow that is a heinous traceback!” you’re saying to yourself! `It’s a
known issue <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/9978>`__, and
rest assured that it’s the correct error just displayed poorly.

.. code:: ipython3

    %crochet_config reset


.. parsed-literal::

    # Resetting Crochet settings to their defaults:
     - timeout=60


Help / APIs
===========

These help commands work in Jupyter and in IPython, but don’t work with
nteract, nor do they render into notebooks. The output of these commands
is therefore pasted in from IPython for convenience.

.. code:: ipython3

    %crochet_config?

::

   In [3]: %crochet_config?
   Docstring:
   ::

     %crochet_config key [value [value ...]]

   Configure settings for Crochet_:

   - *timeout*: How long to wait for autoawaited twisted code to run
     before canceling, in seconds. Defaults to 60. Crochet uses ``2**31``
     internally as a "basically infinity" constant, if you would like
     this limitation to just go away and leave you alone.

   Examples::

       # Show the current config
       %crochet_config show

       %crochet_config set timeout 5

   positional arguments:
     key
     value
   File:      ~/software/jfhbrook/twisted_ipython/twisted_ipython/magic.py

.. code:: ipython3

    %%run_in_reactor?

::

   Docstring:
   ::

     %run_in_reactor [assign [assign ...]]

   Run the contents of the cell using run_in_reactor_.

   When this magic is enabled, the cell will get rewritten to::

       import crochet

       def _cell():
           # Your code here

       @crochet.run_in_reactor
       def _run_in_reactor():
           return _cell()

       _ = _run_in_reactor()
       _

   ``_run_in_reactor`` returns an EventualResult_. The name of the
   variable that this value gets assigned to can be set as an
   argument. For instance::

       %run_in_reactor result

       result.wait(5)

   For more information, see the documentation for crochet_.

   .. _run_in_reactor: https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#run-in-reactor-asynchronous-results

Development
-----------

Setup with Conda and git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, git clone this project:

::

   $ git clone git@github.com:jfhbrook/twisted_ipython.git
   $ cd twisted_ipython

This project comes with an ``environment.yml`` which may be used to
create a conda environment:

::

   $ conda env create

Once the environment is created, you can source it and install the
development version of twisted_ipython:

::

   $ conda activate twisted_ipython
   $ python setup.py develop

Finally, you will need to install this environment as a user kernel:

::

   $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name twisted_ipython

Once these steps are complete, you should be able to find a kernel named
“twisted_ipython” in the appropriate drop-down.

Tests, Linting and Documentation
--------------------------------

This notebook stands as the test suite as well as the primary source of
documentation. Before releasing code, the notebook should be ran from
top to bottom without any (unexpected) errors.

The ``README.md`` can be generated using ``make``:

.. code:: ipython3

    !make docs


.. parsed-literal::

    jupyter nbconvert --to rst README.ipynb
    [NbConvertApp] Converting notebook README.ipynb to rst
    [NbConvertApp] Writing 14265 bytes to README.rst


and linting like so:

.. code:: ipython3

    !make lint


.. parsed-literal::

    flake8 ./twisted_ipython/*.py setup.py


other tasks include ``package`` and ``upload``, which should be ran
in-order by me when publishing this project to pypi.

Support
-------

Just to set expectations: I’m just one guy that had an itch to scratch.
I’ll respond to issues and PRs but I don’t expect this project to take
much of my time. Consider it beta quality software. That said, I plan on
using it semi-regularly, so it will hopefully be pretty solid in
practice.

I develop against python 3.7 but it’s likely that this will work for
older versions of python as well. Python 2 is explicitly unsupported.

I plan to use semver aggressively.
