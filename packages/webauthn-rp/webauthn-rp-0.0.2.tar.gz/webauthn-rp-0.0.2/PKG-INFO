        WebAuthn-RP is a Python 3 library to manage credentials that conform to the 
        [Web Authentication specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/).
        
        You can use it on the server-side to interface with your database and routing layers. It is 
        designed to work across different frameworks without any changes.
