Description: # Advanced Python Development Sensors
        
        This is the data collection package that forms part of the running example
        for the book [Advanced Python Development](https://advancedpython.dev).
        
        ## Usage
        
        This installs a console script called `sensors` that returns a report on
        various aspects of the system. The available sensors are:
        
        * Python version
        * IP Addresses
        * CPU Usage
        * RAM Available
        * Battery charging state
        * Ambient Temperature
        * Ambient Humidity
        
        There are no command-line options, to view the report run `sensors` on the
        command line.
        
        ## Caveats
        
        The Ambient Temperature and Ambient Humidity sensors are only available on
        RaspberryPi hosts and assume that a DHT22 sensor is connected to pin `D20`.
        
        If there is an entry in `/etc/hosts` for the current machine's hostname that
        value will be the only result from the IP Addresses sensor.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install with `pip3 install apd.sensors` under Python 3.7 or higher
