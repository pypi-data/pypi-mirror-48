Description: XIST provides an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parser
        with a very simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type corresponds
        to a Python class and these Python classes provide a conversion method to
        transform the XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered
        'object oriented XSLT'.
        
        XIST also includes the following modules and packages:
        
        * ``ll.ul4c`` is compiler for a cross-platform templating language with
          similar capabilities to `Django's templating language`__. ``UL4`` templates
          are compiled to an internal format, which makes it possible to implement
          template renderers in other languages and makes the template code "secure"
          (i.e. template code can't open or delete files).
        
          __ https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/templates/
        
          There are implementations for Python, Java and Javascript.
        
        * ``ll.ul4on`` provides functions for encoding and decoding a lightweight
          machine-readable text-based format for serializing the object types supported
          by UL4. It is extensible to allow encoding/decoding arbitrary instances
          (i.e. it is basically a reimplementation of ``pickle``, but with string
          input/output instead of bytes and with an eye towards cross-plattform
          support).
        
          There are implementations for Python, Java and Javascript.
        
        * ``ll.orasql`` provides utilities for working with cx_Oracle_:
        
          - It allows calling functions and procedures with keyword arguments.
        
          - Query results will be put into Record objects, where database fields
            are accessible as object attributes.
        
          - The ``Connection`` class provides methods for iterating through the
            database metadata.
        
          - Importing the modules adds support for URLs with the scheme ``oracle`` to
            ``ll.url``.
        
          .. _cx_Oracle: https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/
        
        * ``ll.make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows
          you to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed
          when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one
          of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented
          way and targets are not only limited to files.
        
        * ``ll.color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.
          This includes the ability to convert between different color models
          (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions
          for modifying and mixing colors.
        
        * ``ll.sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.
        
        * ``ll.url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396
          compliant URLs.
        
        * ``ll.nightshade`` can be used to serve the output of PL/SQL
          functions/procedures with CherryPy__.
        
        * ``ll.misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.
        
        * ``ll.astyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI escape
          sequences).
        
        * ``ll.daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.
        
        * ``ll.xml_codec`` contains a complete codec for encoding and decoding XML.

        Changes in 5.46 (released 06/26/2019)
        -------------------------------------
        
        * The method ``ll.scripts.rul4.Globals.log`` now supports the keywords
          arguments ``sep``, ``end`` and ``flush`` with the same meaning as for
          ``print``.
        
        * Exception chaining in ``ll.scripts.rul4.Globals.error`` has been fixed.
        
        * For ``ll.xist.ns.html.astext`` default styles have been added for ``em``,
          ``strong`` and ``i``.
        
        * ``ll.xist.ns.html.astext`` now honors all styles passed as keyword
          arguments not just those for ``h1``, ``h2``, ``h3``, ``h4``, ``h5``, ``h6``,
          ``dl``, ``dt``, ``dd``, ``ol``, ``ol_li``, ``ul``, ``ul_li``, ``pre``,
          ``blockquote``, ``div``, ``p``, ``hr``, ``address``, ``th``, ``td``, ``b``,
          ``u`` and ``code``.
        
        * ``ll.xist.ns.html.astext`` now supports callables for the ``prefix`` and
          ``suffix`` style parameter. If a callable is passed it will be called with
          the node in question and the resulting string is used as the prefix/suffix.
          For example it's possible to output links in Markdown syntax like this::
        
            >>> from ll.xist.ns import html
            >>> e = html.p(
            ...   "We ",
            ...   html.em("love"),
            ...   " ",
            ...   html.a("Python", href="http://www.python.org/"),
            ...   "!"
            ... )
            >>> html.astext(
            ...   e,
            ...   a=dict(
            ...     display="inline",
            ...     prefix="(",
            ...     suffix=lambda n: f")[{n.attrs.href}]"
            ...   )
            ... )
            'We *love* (Python)[http://www.python.org/]!'
