Description: ## Machine Learning - just do it ! 
        #### mellow is a python package that contains some well known machine learning algorithms.
        #### Exclusive to first time learner.
        It provides:
        - most popular machine learning algorithms
        - sophisticated utility functions useful in these algorithms
        - and much more
        
        Often Developers/Students feel hesitation to implement the machine learning algorithms because either they find it hefty or time consuming, what I believe is understanding the machine learning algorithms and the mathematics behind these algorithms is much more important than converting it into code. So I came up with this beautiful library mellow to help you (and myself tbh) out.
