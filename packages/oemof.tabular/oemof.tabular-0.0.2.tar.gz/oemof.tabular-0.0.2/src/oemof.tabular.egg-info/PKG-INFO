        ===========
        
        To run the all tests run::
        
            tox
        
        Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:
        
        .. list-table::
            :widths: 10 90
            :stub-columns: 1

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.0.1 (2018-12-12)
        ------------------
        * Moved the datapackage reader from core `oemof` into this package.
          That means the basic functionality of deserializing energy systems
          from datapackages has finally arrived.
        * Moved `Facade` classes from `renpass` into this package.
          The `Facade` classes are designed to complement the datapackage
          reader, by enabling easy construction of energy system components from
          simple tabular data sources.
        * Also moved the example datapackages from `renpass` into this package.
          These datapackages provide a good way of at least testing, that the
          datapackage reader doesn't throw errors.
        
        0.0.0 (2018-11-23)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
          Pretty much non functional because it only consists of the package
          boilerplate and nothing else. But this is what a version zero is for,
          IMHO.
