## For Windows users printing to _cmd_ or _powershell_

You will encounter an error if you attempt to print the .json() object to the command line. This is because the '{', '}' curly braces to be printed to the console.
This becomes especially annoying if developers wish to get 'under the hood'.

Here is the error:
    UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2019' in position 1444: character maps to <undefined>

This can be fixed by:
    - installing 'win-unicode-console'
        `py -mpip install win-unicode-console`
    - then running it while calling your python script...
        `py -mrun myPythonScript.py`

Another option is hardcoding your console to only print in utf-8. This is a bad idea, as it could ruin many other scripts and/or make errors MUCH more difficult to track.
