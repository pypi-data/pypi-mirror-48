* Create LICENSE
* The Bahub container now does not generate spam
* Added docker/releases/versioning section

* AntiHotlink feature: Resolved a notice about array to string conversion ($\_SERVER['argv'] or $\_SERVER['argc'] was an array)

v2.0.6
------

* Added link to the general guide
* Increased coverage by covering the UploadSecurityContext
* Security: Files without a password cannot be overwritten if not an administrator
* Fixed type error in snapshot command
* Not raising an exception in the notifier, just printing it into the stdout - notification error cannot cancel a backup from creation

v2.0.5
------

* Improving performance of the IoC container by excluding non-service classes

* Fixed HTTP Bytes range support. So now the application serves partial content on-demand when streaming media files, eg. video files
* The \`make run\_dev\` now runs an official docker image rather than the Symfony's built-in webserver. The reason was that the Symfony's built-in webserver does not support range requests and streaming so good as the NGINX does
