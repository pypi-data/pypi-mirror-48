CHANGES
=======

* Docs: Added info how to provision the token
* Create LICENSE
* The Bahub container now does not generate spam
* Added docker/releases/versioning section
* Added info about quay images
* Made a clean up of infrastructural files and added feature toggle to the NGINX, so new features can be toggled on/off
* AntiHotlink feature: Resolved a notice about array to string conversion ($\_SERVER['argv'] or $\_SERVER['argc'] was an array)
* AntiHotlink feature: The value is now unescaped, it makes life so much easier when a unnecessary quotes are applied (eg. in docker container configuration)

v2.0.6
------

* Added link to the general guide
* Increased coverage by covering the UploadSecurityContext
* Security: Files without a password cannot be overwritten if not an administrator
* Fixed type error in snapshot command
* Not raising an exception in the notifier, just printing it into the stdout - notification error cannot cancel a backup from creation
* Added APP\_DOMAIN variable in case when "Host" header could be incorrect because of eg. complex and invalid networking configuration
* Fixed developer toolbar displaying
* Minimum.ui: Polish/Polski translation

v2.0.5
------

* Covered ViewFileHandler partially

* Improving performance of the IoC container by excluding non-service classes

* Covered aggregate with tests
* Fixed HTTP Bytes range support. So now the application serves partial content on-demand when streaming media files, eg. video files
* The \`make run\_dev\` now runs an official docker image rather than the Symfony's built-in webserver. The reason was that the Symfony's built-in webserver does not support range requests and streaming so good as the NGINX does
