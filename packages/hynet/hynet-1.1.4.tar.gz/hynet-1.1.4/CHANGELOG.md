# Change Log

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [1.1.4] - 2019-06-24
- Extended the OPF result summary for cases that are not solved successfully.
- Updated the MATPOWER import to support test cases with missing ``gencost`` data.
- Updated the MATPOWER import to detect and replace infinite (``Inf``) active/reactive power limits.
- Changed the automatic solver selection to *always* select a QCQP solver by default.
- Added ``OPFResult.get_branch_utilization``.

## [1.1.3] - 2019-06-13
- Revised the ampacity constraint generation to improve performance.

## [1.1.2] - 2019-06-07
- Added a chordal conversion to the SDR solver interface for MOSEK.
- Added the suppression of the activity output of the clients in ``OptimizationServer.start_clients``.
- Changed the progress bar of the ``OptimizationServer`` to ``tqdm``.
- Updated the OPF summary (total losses in percent of the active power load).
- Updated the code to address the deprecation of ``numpy.asscalar``.
- Updated the SOCR and SDR solver interface for MOSEK with a scaling of the coupling constraints for duplicate variables to improve the numerical accuracy of the duplication.
- Updated the SOCR solver interface for MOSEK to use a default of ``1e-9`` for ``MSK_DPAR_INTPNT_CO_TOL_DFEAS`` with versions prior to MOSEK v9.0.

## [1.1.1] - 2019-05-17
- Added an IBM CPLEX based SOCR solver interface.
- Added an object-oriented design to the initial point generators and added their support in ``calc_opf``.
- Updated the PICOS solver interface to support PICOS v1.2.0.
- Updated the MOSEK solver interface to support MOSEK v9.0.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-03-28
- Added a feature- and structure-preserving network reduction method for large-scale grids.

## [1.0.8] - 2019-02-26
- Added a setter for the grid name and description of a database (``DBConnection.grid_name`` and ``DBConnection.description``).
- Changed the default tolerance of the IPOPT QCQP solver to ``1e-6`` (was ``1e-7``).

## [1.0.7] - 2019-02-05
- Added average branch utilization statistics to the OPF summary.
- Added a local mode to the optimization server (replaces ``num_local_workers``).
- Added a marginal price property to the ``PWLFunction`` class.
- Changed the automatic solver selection to require a QCQP solver for systems without the *hybrid architecture*.

## [1.0.6] - 2019-01-10
- Fixed an issue in the MATPOWER import with optional data columns of the MATPOWER format.

## [1.0.5] - 2019-01-10
- Added ``Scenario.has_hybrid_architecture``, ``Scenario.get_ac_branches``, ``Scenario.get_dc_branches``, ``Scenario.add_compensator``, ``CapRegion.copy``, ``show_power_balance_error``, and ``show_branch_reconstruction_error``.
- Added an object-oriented design to the rank-1 approximation methods (to avoid the need of closures for their configuration).
- Added the detection of omitted ramping limits in the MATPOWER import.
- Extended the physical validity assessment that underlies ``OPFResult.is_physical``.
- Updated the automatic solver selection and OPF result summary with the consideration of the *hybrid architecture*.
- Changed the default rank-1 approximation to the graph traversal method.
- Removed ``SystemModel.is_acyclic``, ``SystemModel.ac_subgrids``, and ``SystemModel.dc_subgrids``.

## [1.0.4] - 2018-12-28
