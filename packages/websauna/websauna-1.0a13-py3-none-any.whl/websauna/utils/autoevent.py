"""Automatically fire events on function enter and exit.

Use :py:func:`@event_source` to mark methods which fire events::

    class MyClass:

        # Target function
        @event_source
        def my_func(self):
            print("In myfunc")

        def run(self):
            self.my_func()

Create a class which can bind handlers to be called before and after event_source methods::

    class MyHandlers:

        # Aspect function
        @before(MyClass.my_func)
        def extra_logging(self):
            print("Entering my_func")

        # Aspect function
        @after(MyClass.my_func)
        def extra_logging(self):
            print("After my_func")


    # Nothing happens yet
    instance_a = MyClass()
    instance_a.run()
    # ... In myfunc

    # Aspects run on instiated targetters only
    my_handler = MyHandlers()

    instance_b = MyClass()
    bind_events(instance_b, my_handler)
    instance_b.run()
    # ...
    # Entering myfunc
    # In myfunc
    # After myfunc

This implementation

* It is not designed to be a general solution, but targets a very narrow use case only. But you are free to expand.

* Works only on class methods.

* Event sources are named. By default they get name from function name, but you can override this to avoid namespace conflict

* Event handlers are not called if the subclass of ``MyClass`` overrides the parent method and doesn't call ``super()``. In this case you need to call :py:func:`fire_advisor_event` manually from the overriden method.
