Introduction
------------

Throttling is an activity to limit (anonymous) user actions on the site to a certain rate, so that malicious parties cannot overflow the system (send email invites) or exhibit excessive costs (send SMS).

Throttled view decorator
------------------------

This view decorator is suitable for most use cases to protect HTTP endpoints with a global counter stored in Redis.
See :py:func:`websauna.system.form.throttle.throttled_view`.

Throttling submissions in a form
--------------------------------

Preface: You have an action on the site which will send email to an unconfirmed third party. You want to limit the rate of outgoing emails, so that a malicious party cannot use the function to flood third party inboxes.

Example::

    from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPTooManyRequests
    from websauna.system.form import rollingwindow

    @simple_route("/newsletter", route_name="newsletter", renderer='views/newsletter.html', append_slash=False)
    def newsletter(request):
        """Subscribe to news letter from handling."""

        form = get_newsletter_form(request)
        rendered_form = form.render()

        if request.method == "POST":

            # Limit to 60 subscriptions / hour
            limit = int(request.registry.settings.get("trees.newsletter_subscription_limit", 60))

            if rollingwindow.check(request.registry, "invite_friends", window=3600, limit=limit):
                # Alert devops through Sentry
                logger.warning("Newsletter subscription overflow")
                return HTTPTooManyRequests("Too many subscriptions to the newsletter. Please wait 10 minutes and try again.")

            if "subscribe" in request.POST:
                controls = request.POST.items()
                # ... process normally

Throttling form submissions using a Deform validator
----------------------------------------------------

Preface: You have a Deform based form which is open for anonymous submissions. You want to limit the potential problems caused by malicious party by overflooding the form with submissions.

Example::

    import colander as c

    @c.deferred
    def throttle_invites_validator(node, kw):
        """Protect invite functionality from flood attacks."""
        request = kw["request"]

        # Limit to 60 invites / hour
        limit = int(request.registry.settings.get("trees.invite_limit", 60))

        def inner(node, value):
            # Check we don't have many invites going out
            if rollingwindow.check(request.registry, "invite_friends", window=3600, limit=limit):

                # Alert devops through Sentry
                logger.warning("Excessive invite traffic")

                # Tell users slow down
                raise c.Invalid(node, 'Too many outgoing invites at the moment. Please try again later.')

        return inner

Then when you construct the schema instance form you give validator to it explicitly::

    schema = schemas.InviteFriends(validator=schemas.throttle_invites_validator).bind(request=request, user=request.user)
