Pinning down application dependencies (pip freeze)
==================================================

Introduction
============

Before you can start deploying your application you first must freeze it's Python package dependencies. Freezing is a process where :term:`pip` reads the versions of all installed packages in a local virtual environment and then produces a text file with the package version for each python package specified.  By convention, it's named  ``requirements.txt``.

How to perform a freeze
=======================

In your application package root folder run the freeze command. Change ``myapp`` to your package name:

.. code-block:: console

    pip freeze --local | grep -v myapp > requirements.txt

Then commit this file.


What happens without freezing?
==============================

New Python package versions are released every day. Sooner or later one of your project's dependencies will release a version which is not compatible with the API your application expects it to have. Because the ``pip`` command installs latest versions by default, it would install an incompatible package version for your application. This would cause your application to crash or not to start.

``requirements.txt`` maintains the list of absolute version numbers. When ``pip`` uses it to fetch the packages, it always gets the specified version you had when developing the application, not a possibly incompatible latest version.

Cleaning up virtualenv
----------------------

If your virtual environment is polluted and you have not kept one virtual environment per project it is suggested to create a fresh virtual environment from the scratch. Then run ``pip install -e .`` for your web application package when this new environment is activated and it only pulls dependencies actually used by your web applicaiton.

Tracking Websauna master
------------------------

If you need to run your application against Websauna master (or any Git revision) you can edit ``websauna`` dependency in ``requirements.txt``::

    -e git+git@github.com:websauna/websauna.git@master#egg=websauna
