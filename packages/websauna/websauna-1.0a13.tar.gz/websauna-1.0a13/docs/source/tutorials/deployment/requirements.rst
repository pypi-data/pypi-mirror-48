============
Requirements
============

To run a Websauna application you need a server with

* 1 CPU

* 1 GB RAM

* Root access

* Linux (currently Microsoft Windows installations are possible, but untested)

It is possible to run Websauna on a shared hosting, but due to an increased complexity set it up it is not covered here.

.. note::

    It is possible to run Websauna with 512 MB or less RAM, but there are practical deployment problems e.g due to GCC compiler memory usage.

Skills and knowledge
--------------------

Besides being able to use command line and program Python, as you have successfully done this far, some additional requirements apply for doing the deployment:

* Use git version control

* `Basic SSH key usage <https://opensourcehacker.com/2012/10/24/ssh-key-and-passwordless-login-basics-for-developers/>`_

* Basic server management

Hosting providers
