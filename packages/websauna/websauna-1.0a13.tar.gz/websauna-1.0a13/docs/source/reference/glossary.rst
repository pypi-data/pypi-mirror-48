    duplicity
        Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup. Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server. `More info <http://duplicity.nongnu.org/>`__.

    DOM
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in parsed HTML, XHTML, and XML documents. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree. Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects. The public interface of a DOM is specified in its application programming interface (API). `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model>`__.

    DoS
        In computing, a denial-of-service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users, such as to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) is where the attack source is more than one–and often thousands of-unique IP addresses. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack>`__.

    optimistic concurrency control
        Optimistic concurrency control (OCC) is a concurrency control method applied to transactional systems such as relational database management systems and software transactional memory. OCC assumes that multiple transactions can frequently complete without interfering with each other. While running, transactions use data resources without acquiring locks on those resources. Before committing, each transaction verifies that no other transaction has modified the data it has read. If the check reveals conflicting modifications, the committing transaction rolls back and can be restarted. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control>`__.

    production
        The production environment is also known as live, particularly for servers, as it is the environment that users directly interact with. :doc:`Websauna production configuration <../reference/config>`. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Production>`__.

    race condition
        A race condition or race hazard is the behavior of an electronic, software or other system where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended. The term originates with the idea of two signals racing each other to influence the output first. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition>`__.

    Redis
        Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker.

    renderer
        A view callable needn't always return a Response object. If a view happens to return something which does not implement the Pyramid Response interface, Pyramid will attempt to use a renderer to construct a response. Usually renderer is a template name. The template engine loads this template and passes the view return value to it as template context. `More information <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/renderers.html/>`__.

    resource
        In :term:`traversal` resource class presents one path part of the hierarchy. More information in :doc:`traversal documentation <../narrative/view/traversal>`

        Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach. Its testing capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create new higher-level keywords from existing ones using the same syntax that is used for creating test cases. `More information <http://robotframework.org/>`__.

    sanity check
        Sanity check is a Websauna feature which prevents starting up a website in a state where Python code is inconsistent with databases. It checks all databases are up and models are correctly declared in the database. See :ref:`websauna.sanity_check` setting for more info.

    scaffold
        A project skeleton which generates a starting point for your application. Websauna uses :term:`cookiecutter` as the tool to create it, using ``cookiecutter-websauna-app`` and ``cookiecutter-websauna-addon`` templates.

        Sentry is the modern error logging and aggregation platform for production servers. It allows you easily set alerts when errors start appear in :term:`production`. `More information <https://docs.getsentry.com/hosted/>`__.

    session fixation
        Session Fixation is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session. The attack explores a limitation in the way the web application manages the session ID, more specifically the vulnerable web application. When authenticating a user, it doesn’t assign a new session ID, making it possible to use an existent session ID. `More information <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_fixation>`__.

    shared hosting
        Shared web hosting service refers to a web hosting service where many websites reside on one web server connected to the Internet. This is generally the most economical option for hosting, as the overall cost of server maintenance is amortized over many customers. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service>`__.

    slug
        Slug is a descriptive part of the URL that is there to make URL more (human) readable.
        `More information <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/427102/what-is-a-slug-in-django>`__.

    SQL
        SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS). `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`__.

    SQLAlchemy
        SQLAlchemy enables effortless SQL data manipulation from Python programming.

        SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

    SSH
        Secure Shell, or SSH, is a cryptographic (encrypted) network protocol to allow remote login and other network services to operate securely over an unsecured network. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell>`__.

    SSH agent
        SSH is a protocol allowing secure remote login to a computer on a network using public-key cryptography. SSH client programs typically run for the duration of a remote login session and are configured to look for the user's private key in a file in the user's home directory (e.g., .ssh/id_rsa). For added security, it is common to store the private key in an encrypted form, where the encryption key is computed from a passphrase that the user has memorized. Because typing the passphrase can be tedious, many users would prefer to enter it just once per local login session. The most secure place to store the unencrypted key is in program memory, and in Unix-like operating systems, memory is normally associated with a process. A normal SSH client process cannot be used to store the unencrypted key because SSH client processes only last the duration of a remote login session. Therefore, users run a program called ``ssh-agent`` that runs the duration of a local login session, stores unencrypted keys in memory, and communicates with SSH clients using a Unix domain socket. . `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent>`__.


    staging
        Staging site, in website design, is a website used to assemble, test and review its newer versions before it is moved into production. This phase follows the development phase. The staging phase of the software life-cycle is often tested in an environment (hardware and software) that mirrors that of the production environment. :doc:`Websauna staging configuration <../reference/config>`. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staging_site>`__.

    state management
        :term:`SQLAlchemy` database session keeps automatically track of objects you have modified.
        `More information <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_state_management.html>`__.

    Supervisor
        Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems. It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, daemontools, and runit. Unlike some of these programs, it is not meant to be run as a substitute for init as “process id 1”. Instead it is meant to be used to control processes related to a project or a customer, and is meant to start like any other program at boot time.
        `More information <http://supervisord.org/>`__.

    TDD
        Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development/>`__.

    test fixture
        The purpose of test fixtures is to provide a fixed baseline upon which tests can reliably and repeatedly execute. This pattern is extensively used by :term:`pytest`. `More information <http://pytest.org/latest/fixture.html>`__.

    testing
        Testing is the development face when automated test suite is executed against your application. See :ref:`test.ini` configuration reference. See :doc:`How to write and run tests <../narrative/testing/writing>`.

    Tox
        Tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for: checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters, running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice, acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing. `More information <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`__.

    transaction retry
        If a succesfully committed transaction is doomed by the database due to a :term:`race condition` the application tries to replay the HTTP request certain number of times before giving up. This usually works on the assumptions race conditions are rare and the data being modified does not need content locking like protection. See :term:`optimistic concurrency control`.

    URL dispatch
        A method of mapping URLs to views through regular expression. `See full documentation in Pyramid documentation. <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/urldispatch.html>`__.

    UUID
        A universally unique identifier (UUID) is an identifier standard used in software construction. A UUID is simply a 128-bit value. The meaning of each bit is defined by any of several variants. Websauna extensively uses UUID variant 4, which gives a value with 122-bit randomness. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__.

    UTC
        Coordinated Universal, abbreviated as UTC, is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude;[1] it does not observe daylight saving time. `More information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time>`__.

    uWSGI
        The uWSGI project aims at developing a full stack for application servers for various programming languages. Protocols, proxies, process managers and monitors are all implemented using a common api and a common configuration style. `More information <https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#>`__.

    vault
        A vault is a generic term that refers to a file or a service that contains protected secrets, like passwords and private keys.

    view
        A "view callable" is a callable Python object which is associated with a view configuration; it returns a response object. A view callable accepts a single argument: request, which will be an instance of a :term:`request` object. An alternate calling convention allows a view to be defined as a callable which accepts a pair of arguments: context object and :term:`request`: this calling convention is useful for traversal-based applications in which a context is always very important. A view callable is the primary mechanism by which a developer writes user interface code within :term:`Pyramid`. See :ref:`views`.

    view mapper
        A view mapper is an object in :term:`Pyramid` that accepts a set of keyword arguments and which returns a callable. The returned callable is called with the view callable object. The returned callable should itself return another callable which can be called with the "internal calling protocol" (context, request). `Read more <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/hooks.html#using-a-view-mapper>`__.


    virtual environment
        An isolated environment (folder) where all installed Python packages go. Each project should have its own virtual environment, so that different project dependencies do not mess up each other. `Read more <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/installing.html>`__.

    Waitress
        Waitress is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones which live in the Python standard library. It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python 2.6+ and Python 3.2+. It is also known to run on PyPy 1.6.0+ on UNIX. It supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. `Read more <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/waitress>`__.

    WSGI
        The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a specification for simple and universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for the Python programming language. It was originally specified in PEP 333 authored by Phillip J. Eby, and published on 7 December 2003. It has since been adopted as a standard for Python web application development. The latest version of the specification is v1.0.1, also known as PEP 3333, published on 26 September 2010. `Read more <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface>`__.
