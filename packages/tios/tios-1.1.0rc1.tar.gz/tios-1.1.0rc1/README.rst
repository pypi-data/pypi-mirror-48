TIOS : The internet of things for MD Simulations.
=================================================

**Tios** is being developed to support research into alternative paradigms for simulation science - particularly molecular dynamics (MD).

In the spirit of
the *Internet of Things* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things), **tios** turns conventional MD simulations into streaming web applications. Data production and data capture are decoupled: data collectors can gather what they want from wherever they like, whenever they like. Simulation science becomes more akin to field work than autopsy.

For details, please see the wiki pages.
