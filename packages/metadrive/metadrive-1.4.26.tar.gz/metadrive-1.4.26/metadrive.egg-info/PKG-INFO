        Metadrive helps users gather the information from different Internet
        resources (e.g. `Linkedin <https://linkedin.com>`__, `HTH
        Worldwide <https://hthworldwide.com>`__, etc). It provides one API to
        rule them all, and allows mounting and syncing web resources, as if they
        are disks on your operating system. To gather the information from a
        specific resource, there must be so called driver written specifically
        for the resource. There are drivers which already exist. For example, \*
        Halfbakery:
        `halfbakery\_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/halfbakery_driver>`__
        \* Linkedin:
        `linkedin\_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/linkedin_driver>`__ \*
        Metaculus:
        `metaculus\_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/metaculus_driver>`__ \*
        HTH Worldwide:
        `hthworld\_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/hthworld_driver>`__ \*
        Kompass:
        `kompass\_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/kompass_driver>`__ \*
        ResearchGate:
        `researchgate\_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/researchgate_driver>`__
        \* Versli Lietuva:
        `verslilietuva\_driver <https://github.com/drivernet/verslilietuva_driver>`__
        
        Some of the drivers are awaiting to be implemented. Studying the
        Metadrive API will help developers to write the drivers for those
        resources which are needed them right now. A unified API is the killer
        feature of Metadrive and allows writing drivers to have a unified UI to
        the whole world.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        The guide provides for the instructions on how to install Metadrive to a
        virtual environment, so create and activate it first, running the
        following commands:
        
        ::
        
            virtualenv -p python3.7 metadrive-env
            . ./metadrive-env/bin/activate
        
        Then, install Metadrive from its source code
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/wefindx/metadrive.git
            cd metadrive
            pip install -e .
        
        or from its package
        
        ::
        
            pip install metadrive
        
        Finally, run Metadrive, executing
        
        ::
        
            provide
        
        The command above will ask you to type your GitHub username. When you
        are done, the ``.metadrive/config`` will be created in your home
        directory and the server will start. The example of how
        ``.metadrive/config`` may look like:
        
        ::
        
            [GITHUB]
            username = mindey
        
            [API]
            host = 0.0.0.0
            port = 7000
        
            [CONSOLE]
            host = 0.0.0.0
            port = 7001
        
            [DRIVER_BACKENDS]
            chrome = /usr/bin/chromedriver
        
            [PROXIES]
            http =
            https =
        
            [GPG]
            key = 5AFDB16B89805133F450688BDA580D1D5F5CC7AD
        
        However, ``provide`` does not auto-reload and requires re-running, so if
        you want to run Metadrive for the development purposes, interrupt the
        ``provide`` process and execute the following command
        
        ::
        
            uvicorn metadrive.api:app --debug
        
        Installing drivers
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        After finishing the Metadrive installation you may check the drivers
        available right now.
        
        ::
        
            $ curl http://127.0.0.1:7000/drivers
            []
        
        So, there are no drivers and it's ok since they have to be installed
        separately.
        
        Choose one of the above-mentioned drivers. Let's say it's
        ``linkedin_driver``. Execute the following command to install it
        
        ::
        
            pip install linkedin_driver
        
        and run the second-to-last command one more time
        
        ::
        
            $ curl http://127.0.0.1:7000/drivers
            [{"id":"http://0.0.0.0:7000/driver/linkedin-driver","site":"https://www.linkedin.com","package":"linkedin-driver==0.1.8"}]
        
        Here's the driver which has just been installed.
