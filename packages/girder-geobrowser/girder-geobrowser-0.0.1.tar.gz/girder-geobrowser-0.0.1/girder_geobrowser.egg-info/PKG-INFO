Description: # Girder GeoBrowser
        
        ## Requirements
        * The Girder [Geospatial](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/girder_geospatial) Plugin
        
        ## Plugin Installation
        ```
        pip install .
        ```
        
        
        ## Standalone Frontend Setup
        
        ### Install Yarn
        ```
        npm install -g yarn
        ```
        
        ### Install Frontend packages
        ```
        cd gui
        yarn install
        ```
        
        ### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
        ```
        yarn run serve
        ```
        
        ### Compiles and minifies for production
        ```
        yarn run build
        ```
        
        If you've cloned the repo and are developing for the plugin, there is a custom command in `setup.py` that will automate installing yarn packages, building the frontend for production, and copying the dist folder to the proper location. To use this, run: `python setup.py build_ui`. To clean the directory of the files generated from running this command, run `python setup.py clean_build`
        
        **WARNING**
        
        If you run `girder serve` in development mode, the standalone frontend will not be served at `/geobrowser`. This is because it is expected that the frontend will be served on its own (E.g. `yarn run serve`) in order to see the changes being made. If for some reason you need to serve the frontend at `/geobrowser`, you will need to run girder serve in production mode. However be aware that in this case it is serving the pre-built files, and thus no changes will take affect until you rebuild the frontend (E.g. by running `python setup.py build_ui`).
        
        ### Run your tests
        ```
        yarn run test
        ```
        
        ### Lints and fixes files
        ```
        yarn run lint
        ```
        
        ### Customize configuration
        See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
