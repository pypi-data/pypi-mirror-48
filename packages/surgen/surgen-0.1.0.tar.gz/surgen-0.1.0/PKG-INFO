        Surgen is a tool and library to help perform automated upgrades to codebases. It's goals are:
        
        * provide a simple CLI to facilitate upgrading codebases
        * provide libraries to allow easy authoring of code migration scripts.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Surgen is available as a command line tool, providing the directory
        containing surgen scripts, and the directory to apply them to:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            surgen ./my_upgrade_scripts ./my_target_directory
        
        Both arguments are optional, and default to the ./surgen-scripts
        directory and the current working directory, respectively.
        
        Surgen Script
        =============
        
        A surgen script MUST contain a class that:
        
            * extends surgen.Procedure
            * overrides operate(self)
            * does NOT override __init__
        
        A surgen script can:
        
            * provide a should_run function to determine if the script should run (default true)
        
        
        Examples of surgen scripts can be found in the examples/ directory.
