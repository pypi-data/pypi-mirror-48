Description: # ppb-vector
        The immutable, 2D vector class for the PursuedPyBear project.
        
        `Vector` implements many convenience features, as well as
        useful mathematical operations for 2D geometry.
        
        ## Install
        
        You can install `Vector` pip package using
        
        ```bash
        pip install 'ppb-vector'
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        `Vector` is an immutable 2D Vector, which is instantiated as expected: 
        
            >>> from ppb_vector import Vector
            >>> Vector(3, 4)
            Vector(3.0, 4.0)
        
        
        See the [API reference] for an overview of the functionality.
        
        Version numbers follow the [semantic versioning] convention, so [requiring]
        `ppb-vector ~= 1.0` is appropriate for software developped against this release:
        the version specification will match any 1.x release, starting with 1.0.
