Description: deltascope
        ===========
        
        This package is designed to quantify biological structures in 3D image data. 
        
        Features
        +++++++++
        
        - Compare sets of 3D biological images to identify differences
        - Automatically align the structure in the image to correct for variation introduced during mounting and imaging 
        - Generate descriptive graphs that quantify both the average and variation of the data
        - Use machine learning techniques to classify samples and identify regions of statistically significant difference
