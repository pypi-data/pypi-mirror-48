Description: Django-machina
        ##############
        
        Django-machina is a forum framework for Django providing a way to build community-driven websites.
        It offers a full-featured yet very extensible forum solution:
        
        * Topic and post editing
        * Forums tree management
        * Per-forum permissions
        * Anonymous posting
        * Polls and attachments
        * Moderation and pre-moderation
        * Forum conversations search
        * ...
        
        Django-machina was built with integration in mind: the application is designed to be used inside
        existing Django applications. It is not a standalone forum solution.
        
        Django-machina was built with customization and extensibility in mind: each single functionality
        of the application can be customized or overriden to accommodate with your needs.
