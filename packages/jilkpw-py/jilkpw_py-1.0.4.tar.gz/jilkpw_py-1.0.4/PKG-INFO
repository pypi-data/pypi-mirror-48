        To install `jilkpw_py`, please simply input the following command into your terminal:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install jilkpw_py
        ```

        ### Using
        
        To use `jilkpw_py`, please open your preffered IDE/text editor and input the following:
        
        #### Get a specific listing
        
        ```py
        from jilkpw_py import JilkpwWrapper # Import the class
        
        wrapper_name_here = JilkpwWrapper() # Initating an object under `jilkpw_py`
        
        dict_output = wrapper_name_here.find(478363034990149634) # Returns a dict for the given guild_id or throws an exeption
        
        print(dict_output) # Print the output to screen
        ```
        
        #### Get all listings
        
        ```py
        from jilkpw_py import JilkpwWrapper # Import the class
        
        wrapper_name_here = JilkpwWrapper() # Initating an object under `jilkpw_py`
        
        dict_output = wrapper_name_here.all() # Returns a dict of all servers on jilkpw or throws an exeption
        
        print(dict_output) # Print the output to screen
        ```
        
        #### Note
        
        This will give a basic implamentation of `jilkpw_py` but as you can see below, there are various errors you have to catch (hint: try/except around the `dict_output = wrapper_name_here.find(478363034990149634)` line).
        
        ### Exceptions
        
        #### HTTP Errors
        
        - `NotFound`: Jilk.pw could not find the guild_id you passed in
        - `BadRequest`: A request to Jilk.pw was not handled properly & was aborted
        - `NotAuthed`: For whatever reason, you are not authorized to use Jilk.pw's public api
        - `WebMoved`: Jilk.pw has moved
        - `WebTimeout`: Request to Jilk.pw timed out, please try again later
        - `UriTooLong`: The URI is too long for the server to process
        - `MiscError`: HTTP response code is `x` (not incl 200 or previously used)
        
        ### Misc Errors
        
        - `CannotMain`: If you try to run the module directly
