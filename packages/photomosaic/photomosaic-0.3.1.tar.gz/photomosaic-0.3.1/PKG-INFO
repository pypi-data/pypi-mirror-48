        [John Louis Del Rosario](https://github.com/john2x) also has a
        [photomosaic project](https://github.com/john2x/photomosaic) in Python. I
        studied his code while I began writing version 0.1.0 of this project in 2012,
        and there were similarities. Version 0.2.0 (2016) is a complete rewrite that
        takes a fundamentally different approach.
