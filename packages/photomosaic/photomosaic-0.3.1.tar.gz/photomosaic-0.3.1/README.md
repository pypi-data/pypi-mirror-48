viewed at a distance, gives the impression of one large photo.

[John Louis Del Rosario](https://github.com/john2x) also has a
[photomosaic project](https://github.com/john2x/photomosaic) in Python. I
studied his code while I began writing version 0.1.0 of this project in 2012,
and there were similarities. Version 0.2.0 (2016) is a complete rewrite that
takes a fundamentally different approach.
