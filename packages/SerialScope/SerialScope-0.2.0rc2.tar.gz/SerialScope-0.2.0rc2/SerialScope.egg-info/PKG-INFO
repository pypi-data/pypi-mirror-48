        A serial port dual-channel oscilloscope. __Python 3 only__.

            $ pip install SerialScope --user    # just for you
        or,
        
            $ sudo -E pip install SerialScope   # for all users
        
        After installation, launch it. 
        
            $ serialscope
           
        Path `~/.local/bin` should be in your `PATH` environment variable.
        
        or,
            
            $ python3 -m SerialScope 
            
        
        The default baud rate is `115200`. The oscilloscope will automatically 
        find any serial port which has arduino connected to it.
        
        __TODO/FIXME__ You can change these values from command line
        
        ```

        # How it works
        
        This oscilloscope has two channels.  It assumes that 1 byte of data is sent
        for each channel. If you are using arduino's analog pins to read data, then 
        your resolution would be `5/255` volts.
        
        ## Arduino board
        
        Function `analogRead` returns 10 bit value i.e., between 0 and 1023. You should
        scale it to 255, cast it to `char` before writing to serial port. This is for efficiency.
        Sending 10 bits data requires sending 2 bytes. For 2 channels, this would slow 
        down the sampling rate by 4X compared to when only 1 byte is sent per channel.
        
        You can use following snippets in your sketch.
        
        Make sure that your arduino is set to use maximum possible baud-rate. I have
        used 115200 baud rate.,
        
        ```
        // Two critical functions.
        char intToChar( int val)
        {
            // analogRead is 10 bits. Change it to 8 bits.
            char x = (char) (255.0 * val/1023.0);
            return x;
        }
        
        void write_data_line( )
        {
            // channel A is on pin A0 and channel B is on A1
            char a = intToChar(analogRead(A0));
            char b = intToChar(analogRead(A1));
            Serial.print(a);
            Serial.print(b);
            Serial.flush();
        }
        ```
        
        A sketch is available in `SerialScopeArduino/` directory. Open it in your
        arduino IDE and upload to your Arduino board.
