ZAP (the Zurich Atmosphere Purge)
---------------------------------

Tired of sky subtraction residuals? ZAP them!

ZAP is a high precision sky subtraction tool which can be used as complete sky
subtraction solution, or as an enhancement to previously sky-subtracted MUSE
data.  The method uses PCA to isolate the residual sky subtraction features and
remove them from the observed datacube. Future developments will include
modification for use on a variety of instruments.

The last stable release of ZAP can be installed simply with pip::

    pip install zap

Or into the user path with::

    pip install --user zap
