Complex bioinformatic data analysis workflows involving multiple scripts
in different languages can be difficult to consolidate, share, and reproduce.
An environment that streamlines the entire data collection, analysis,
visualization and reporting processes of such multi-language analyses is
currently lacking.

We developed Script of Scripts (SoS) Notebook, an interactive data analysis
environment in which data from different scripting languages flow freely
within and across languages. SoS Notebook features a multi-language notebook
interface, a protocol for cross-language variable exchange, a preview engine
to visualize variables and common bioinformatic file formats, and a
report-generation tool to create dynamic documents from steps in different
languages. SoS Notebook enables researchers to perform sophisticated
bioinformatic analysis using the most suitable tools for different parts of
the workflow, without the limitations of a particular language or
complications of cross-language communications.
