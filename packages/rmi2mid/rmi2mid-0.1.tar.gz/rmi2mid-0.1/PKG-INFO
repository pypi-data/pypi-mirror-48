Description: # rmi2mid
        
        Extract Standard MIDI file (.mid) from RIFF MIDI (RMID) file (.rmi or .mid).
        
        This is a simple tool to extract minimal RMID chunk from RIFF file (usually with extension .rmi or .mid) and write MIDI data to an independent .mid file.
        
        I wrote this because my favorite MIDI player cannot read RIFF MIDI I collected many years ago.
        
        # Usage
        
        ```
        python3 -m rmi2mid <.rmi or .mid> <.mid>
        ```
        
        # Unsupported format
        
        Currently an RIFF file with (nested) LIST chunks is not supported.
        
        # TODO
        
        * Write a chunk parser. [PEP 594](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0594/) is going to deprecate and remove chunk module from python 3.8 and 3.10.
