Building as a C library
-----------------------

stimage is using waf for its build system.

waf does not need to be installed.  A local copy is included in this
distribution, which requires only that Python 2.3 - 3.1 is installed.

waf can be used either in the traditional UNIX way:

  > ./configure
  > make
  > make install (optionally)

or by calling the waf script directly:

  > ./waf configure
  > ./waf build
  > ./waf install (optionally)

For more information, run:

  > ./waf --help

Once built, the unit tests may be run using:

  > ./waf test

build.cfg file
``````````````

Commandline arguments to 'configure' may also be provided in a file,
'build.cfg'.  This file can contain any commandline arguments accepted
by the configure command.  An example is given in the
build.cfg.example file.

Building as a Python library
----------------------------

The Python library is built using the standard distutils suite:

   python setup.py build
   python setup.py install
