        Odoo utility functions with commnd line interfaces.
        
        1.Before runing the scripts, make sure you have activated your virtual enviroment,
        and installed the dependencies:  
        
        ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
        
        
        Features
        --------
        1. Safely remove dependencies of the Odoo modules...
        you can either pass modules in a list from the cmd line, or you can just use a file
        with the modules listed in the first line of the file.  
        
        
        Install the package from the source
        -----------------------------------
        ``pip3 install odut``
        
        
        **Windows**::
        
          $ odut --modules "['account', 'crm']" --base_dir 'Path to your addons'
        
        **Macos/Linux**::
        
          $ odut --modules "['account', 'crm']" --base_dir 'Path to your addons'
        
        
        Packaging Up
        -------------
        
        Locally
        ........
        
        Develop mode::
        
          $ # testing locally in development mode.
          $ python setup.py develop
        
          $ python setup.py develop --uninstall
        
        Packaging up to Pypi
        .....................
        
        
        Create the distribution file::
        
          $ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        
        run commands to check the errors::
        
          $ twine check dist/*
        
        Uploading to Pypi::
        
          $ python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
        
        
        **Caution**:dist file of same name cannot be uploaded again.
        
        About setup.py
        ---------------
        
        python setup.py install is used to install (typically third party) packages that you're not going 
        to develop/modify/debug yourself.
        
        For your own stuff, you want to first install your package and then be able to frequently edit 
        the code without having to re-install the package every time — and that is exactly what python 
        setup.py develop does: 
        
        it installs the package (typically just a source folder) in a way that allows you to 
        conveniently edit your code after it’s installed to the (virtual) environment,
        and have the changes take effect immediately.
        
        Note that it is highly recommended to use pip install . (install) and pip install -e . (developer install) 
        to install packages, as invoking setup.py directly will do the wrong things for many dependencies, such as pull
        prereleases and incompatible package versions, or make the package hard to uninstall with pip.
