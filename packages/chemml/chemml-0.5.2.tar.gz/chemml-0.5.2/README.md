# ChemML
ChemML is a machine learning and informatics program suite for the analysis, mining, and modeling of chemical and materials data.
Please check the [ChemML website](https://hachmannlab.github.io/chemml) for more information.

   - ChemML documentation: https://hachmannlab.github.io/chemml

## Code Design:
ChemML is developed in the Python 3 programming language and makes use of a host of data analysis and ML libraries(accessible through the Anaconda distribution), as well as domain-specific libraries. 
The development follows a strictly modular and object-oriented design to make the overall code as flexible and versatile as possible.

The format of library is similar to the well known libraries like Scikit-learn. ChemML will be soon available 
via graphical user interface provided by [ChemEco](https://github.com/hachmannlab/chemeco).
ChemEco is a general-purpose framework for data mining without coding. It also interfaces with many of the libraries that supply methods for the 
representation, preprocessing, analysis, mining, and modeling of large-scale chemical data sets.


## Latest Version:
   - to find the latest version and release history, click [here](https://pypi.org/project/chemml/#history)

## Installation and Dependencies:
You can download ChemML from PyPI via pip.

    pip install chemml --user -U

Here is a list of external libraries that will be installed with chemml:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - tensorflow
   - keras
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - lxml

Since conda installation is not available for ChemML yet, we recommend installing rdkit and openbabel in a conda virtual environment prior to 
installing ChemML. For doing so, you need to follow the conda installer:

    conda create --name my_chemml_env python=3.6
    source activate my_chemml_env
    conda install -c openbabel openbabel
    conda install -c rdkit rdkit
    pip install chemml

## Python 2 Fans
The library was initially compatible with Python 2 and 3, and we still develop compatible codes. However, since the Python community
and some of the dependencies are phasing out support for Python 2, we also removed it from the classifier languages.
However, you should still be able to clone the ChemML repository from github and install the older versions of some of the dependencies that 
support Python 2, prior to using ChemML locally.
