Description: # EmbEval
        
        EmbEval is a framework that aims to provide a way to evaluate an arbitrary amount of word embeddings in an arbitrary amount of tasks, in parallel.
        
        To aid with the interpretability of the results, embeval resorts to graphs to visualize the performance of the different type of embeddings across each task.
        
        More information will be revealed as development progresses.
