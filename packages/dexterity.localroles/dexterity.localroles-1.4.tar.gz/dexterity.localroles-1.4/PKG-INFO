        Introduction
        ============
        
        Allow to define local roles settings by dexterity type.
        
        A new configuration page is added as a new tab on a dexterity type configuration.
        
        You can now define for each state which principal will receive some local roles automatically.
        
        By example:
        
        * on the "pending" state, the "stephen" user will receive the following role: Reviewer.
        * on the "published" state, the 'editors' group will receive the following roles: Editor, Reviewer.
        
        Those automaticaly given roles cannot be manually removed by the "sharing" tab (read only, as inherited roles).
        
        This package is a base for dexterity.localrolesfield that adds a field to define the principal.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * Add dexterity.localroles to your eggs.
        * Re-run buildout.
        * Done.
