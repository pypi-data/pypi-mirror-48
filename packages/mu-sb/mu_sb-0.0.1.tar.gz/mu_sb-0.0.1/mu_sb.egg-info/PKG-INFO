Description: Mu - A Simple Python Code Editor 
        ================================

        Mu is a simple code editor for beginner programmers based on extensive feedback
        from teachers and learners. Having said that, Mu is for anyone who wants to use
        a simple "no frills" editor.
        
        Mu is a modal editor with modes for Adafruit's CircuitPython, the micro:bit's
        version of MicroPython, PyGame Zero and standard Python 3 (including a
        graphical debugger). Some of the modes make available a REPL (either
        running on the connected CircuitPython or MicroPython device or as a Jupyter
        based iPython session in Python3 mode).
        
        Mu is written in Python and works on Windows, macOS, Linux and Raspberry Pi. The
        project's public facing website is
        `https://codewith.mu/ <https://codewith.mu/>`_. We celebrate the work done by
        users of mu at `https://madewith.mu/ <https://madewith.mu/>`_.
        
        We have `extensive developer documentation <https://mu.readthedocs.io/>`_
        including a guide for
        `setting up a development environment <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html>`_, 
        `contributor guidelines <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ and
        `some suggested first steps <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-steps.html>`_.
        
        We want our community to be a friendly place. Therefore, we expect contributors
        and collaborators to follow our
