Bleak is an acronym for Bluetooth Low Energy platform Agnostic Klient.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://bleak.readthedocs.io.

Bleak is a GATT client software, capable of connecting to BLE devices
acting as GATT servers. It is designed to provide a asynchronous,
cross-platform Python API to connect and communicate with e.g. sensors.

**Be warned: Bleak is still in an early state of implementation.**

Features
--------

* Supports Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update)
* Supports Linux distributions with BlueZ >= 5.43
* Plans on macOS support via Core Bluetooth API (see `develop` branch for progress)

Bleak supports reading, writing and getting notifications from
GATT servers, as well as a function for discovering BLE devices.
