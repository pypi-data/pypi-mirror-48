        # Python Call Graph
        
        Note: This is a fork of the original [pycallgraph](https://github.com/gak/pycallgraph) since it became unmaintained.
        
        Welcome! pycallgraph2 is a [Python](http://www.python.org) module that creates [call graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) visualizations for Python applications.
        
        ## Project Status
        
        The project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/daneads/pycallgraph2), where you can [report issues](https://github.com/daneads/pycallgraph2/issues), contribute to the project by [forking the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) then creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), or just browse the source code.
        
        The fork needs documentation. Feel free to contribute :)

        ## Features
        
        * Support for Python 2.7+ and Python 3.3+.
        * Static visualizations of the call graph using various tools such as Graphviz and Gephi.
        * Execute pycallgraph from the command line or import it in your code.
        * Customisable colors. You can programatically set the colors based on number of calls, time taken, memory usage, etc.
        * Modules can be visually grouped together.
        * Easily extendable to create your own output formats.
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        OS dependencies:
        
        * Graphviz is open source software and can be installed on Ubuntu/Debian via `apt install graphviz`, or equivalent on other distributions.
          [See here for more information](https://graphviz.org/download/).
        
        Installation is easy as:
        
            pip install pycallgraph2
        
        The following examples specify graphviz as the outputter, so it's required to be installed. They will generate a file called `pycallgraph.png`.
        
        The command-line method of running pycallgraph is::
        
            $ pycallgraph graphviz -- ./mypythonscript.py
        
        A simple use of the API is::
        
            from pycallgraph2 import PyCallGraph
            from pycallgraph2.output import GraphvizOutput
        
            with PyCallGraph(output=GraphvizOutput()):
                code_to_profile()
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Documentation for the fork is a work in progress.
