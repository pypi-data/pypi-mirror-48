        nbpages is a command line tool for managing a collection of Jupyter notebooks published on
        [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This project was inspired by the tools included with the
        [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by
        [Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp).
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install nbpages
        
        To upgrade a previously installed version to the latest version
        
            pip install nbpages --upgrade
        
        ## Setting up the notebook repository
        
        The first step in publishing a collection of notebooks on Github Pages is to
        [create a repository on Github.com](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository).
        Github Pages are enabled under the settings tab for the repository. Scroll down to the Github Pages heading and select
        `master branch` for the source. This is also a good time to select a theme for the published collection.
        
        `nbpages` requires a local copy of the repository that can be created by cloning the remote repository.
        Then from the command line, navigate to the top level directory of the local repository and issue the command
        
            nbpages --setup
        
        Directories named `notebooks` and `templates` will be created if they do not already exist.  A configuration file
        `config` will be created inside the directory using data read from the `.git`. Jinja templates `README.md.jinja` and
        `notebook_header.jinja` willed created if they don't already exist. These templates can be edited as required
        using data fields defined in `config`.
        
        ## Notebook organization
        
        Notebooks are maintained within the `notebooks` directory. Thare are organized into a chapter/section heirarchy
        using a filename prefix. Filenames have an `nn.mm-` prefix where`nn` refers to the chapter number or, if a letter, to
        an Appendix. The digits `mm` refers to the section number. Section `00` is reserved to hold the chapter title and
        any introductory material. The notebooks must also have the usual `.ipynb` suffix.
        
        ## Normal usage
        
        Following setup, the normal use of `nbpages` is to execute the command line
        
            nbpages
        
        from the top level directory of the notebook repository. Normally this command would be between completing edits or
        additions to the notebooks and prior to a github commit. The command will
        
        * add or amend headers and navigation bars in all notebooks,
        * write a table of contents file
        * write a keyword index
        * write README.md using the template file
        
        ## Utilities
        
        To help achieve a consistent style over a collection of notebooks, use the command
        
            nbpages --lint
        
        to locate some forms of notebook 'lint'.  A current list of additional features can be found
        
            nbpages --help
