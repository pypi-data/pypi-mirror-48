Description: 
                    Python implementation for a OSM / Openaddresses.io Geocoder.
        
                    This geocoder is implemented in PostgreSQL DB functions as much as possible, there is a simple API and an example flask app included.
        
                    You will need PostgreSQL 9.5+ (or 11.0+ for Openaddresses.io) with PostGIS installed as well as some disk space and data-files from OpenStreetMap and (optionally) OpenAddresses.io.
        
                    Data import will be done via [Omniscale's imposm3](https://github.com/omniscale/imposm3) and a supplied python script to import the openaddresses.io data.
        
                    Optionally you can use the [libpostal machine learning address classifier](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) to parse addresses supplied as input to the forward geocoder.
        
                    For formatting the addresses from the reverse geocoder the `worldwide.yml` from [OpenCageData address-formatting repository](https://github.com/OpenCageData/address-formatting) is used to format the address according to customs in the country that is been encoded.
        
                    See `README.md` in the [repository](https://github.com/dunkelstern/osmgeocoder) for more information.
