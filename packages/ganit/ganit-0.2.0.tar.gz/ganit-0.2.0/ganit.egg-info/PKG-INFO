Description: # Ganit
        An open source Multi-Platform Multi-Language support Programming Language/Library for Calculation Utility. The implementation is planned to be using [Split and Merge](https://github.com/vassilych/cscs) algorithm.
        
        ## The Plan
        
        This is a project which is in planning phase and all the required publishing channels have been created. The main moto of this project is to create a Programming Language. The language will also be ported to many languages as library. This will facilitate any developer to work with mathematical expressions. This is lightweight and will have a limilted set of features as compared to Matlab, Wolfram, GNU Octave etc.
        
        The language is planned to be ported to the following languages as libraries -
        
        1. dotnet
        1. JavaScript
        1. python
        1. Java
        1. Rust
        1. C
        1. Shell Script
        1. dos
