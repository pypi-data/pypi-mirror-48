API  (TODO)
-----------

Flower API enables to manage the cluster via REST API, call tasks and
receive task events in real-time via WebSockets.

For example you can restart worker's pool by: ::

    $ curl -X POST http://localhost:5555/api/worker/pool/restart/myworker

Or call a task by: ::

    $ curl -X POST -d '{"args":[1,2]}' http://localhost:5555/api/task/async-apply/tasks.add

Or terminate executing task by: ::

    $ curl -X POST -d 'terminate=True' http://localhost:5555/api/task/revoke/8a4da87b-e12b-4547-b89a-e92e4d1f8efd

Or receive task completion events in real-time:

.. code-block:: javascript 

    var ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5555/api/task/events/task-succeeded/');
    ws.onmessage = function (event) {
        console.log(event.data);
    }
