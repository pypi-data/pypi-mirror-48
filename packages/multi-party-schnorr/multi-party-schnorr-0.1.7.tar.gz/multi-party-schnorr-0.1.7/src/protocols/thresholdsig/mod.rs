/// Schnorr signature variants:
/// Elliptic Curve Schnorr signatures for message m and public key P generally involve
/// a point R, integers e and s picked by the signer, and generator G which satisfy e = H(R || m)
/// and sG = R + eP. Two formulations exist, depending on whether the signer reveals e or R:
/// (1) Signatures are (e,s) that satisfy e = H(sG - eP || m).
/// This avoids minor complexity introduced by the encoding of the point R in the signature
/// (2) Signatures are (R,s) that satisfy sG = R + H(R || m)P. This supports batch verification,
/// as there are no elliptic curve operations inside the hashes.
