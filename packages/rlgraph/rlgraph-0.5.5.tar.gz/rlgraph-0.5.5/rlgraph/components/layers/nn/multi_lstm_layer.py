class MultiLSTMLayer(NNLayer):
    """
    A multi-LSTM layer processing an initial internal state vector and a batch of sequences to produce
    a final internal state and a batch of output sequences.
    """
    def __init__(
            self, num_lstms, units, use_peepholes=False, cell_clip=None, static_loop=False,
            forget_bias=1.0, parallel_iterations=32, return_sequences=True,
            swap_memory=False, skip_connections=None, **kwargs):
        """
        Args:
            num_lstms (int): The number of LSTMs to stack deep.
            units (Union[List[int],int]): The number of units in the different LSTMLayers' cells.
            use_peepholes (Union[List[bool],bool]): True to enable diagonal/peephole connections from the c-state into
                each of the layers. Default: False.
            cell_clip (Optional[Union[List[float],float]]): If provided, the cell state is clipped by this value prior
                to the cell output activation. Default: None.
            static_loop (Union[bool,int]): If an int, will perform a static RNN loop (with fixed sequence lengths
                of size `static_loop`) instead of a dynamic one (where the lengths for each input can be different).
                In this case, time_major must be set to True (as transposing for this case has not been automated yet).
                Default: False.
            forget_bias (float): The forget gate bias to use. Default: 1.0.
            parallel_iterations (int): The number of iterations to run in parallel.
                Default: 32.
            return_sequences (bool): Whether to return one output for each input or only the last output.
                Default: True.
            swap_memory (bool): Transparently swap the tensors produced in forward inference but needed for back
                prop from GPU to CPU. This allows training RNNs which would typically not fit on a single GPU,
                with very minimal (or no) performance penalty.
                Default: False.
            skip_connections (Optional[List[List[bool]]]): An optional list of lists (2D) of bools indicating the skip
                connections for the input as well as outputs of each layer and whether these should be concatenated
                with the "regular" input for each layer. "Regular" here means the output from the previous layer.
                Example:
                A 4-layer LSTM:
                skip_connections=[
                    #   x    out0   out1   out2   out3    <- outputs (or x)
                                                          # layer 0 (never specified, only takes x as input)
                    [ True,  True, False, False, False],  # layer 1
                    True (for all outputs)                # layer 2
                    [ False, False, False, True, False],  # layer 3
                    ...
                ]
                0) Layer0 does not need to be specified (only takes x, obviously).
                1) Layer1 takes x concatenated with the output of layer0.
                2) Layer2 takes x and both out0 and out1, all concatenated.
                3) Layer3 takes only out2 as input.
                4) A missing sub-list in the main `skip_connections` list means that this layer only takes the previous
                    layer's output (no further skip connections for that layer).
