Description: 
        RLgraph is a framework to quickly prototype, define and execute reinforcement learning
        algorithms both in research and practice. RLgraph supports both
        TensorFlow (or static graphs in general) and Pytorch (eager/define-by run execution) through
        a single component based interface. An introductory blogpost can be found here:
