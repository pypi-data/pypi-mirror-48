#about,None,Provides an overview of the IoT Greenhouse system.,The IoT Greenhouse is a learning system developed to teach the fundamentals of Python programming and Internet of Things (IoT). It removes barriers of existing IoT training solutions by abstracting both hardware and software components. Students interact with hardware without challenges that building prototype circuits create. Additionally students quickly create robust Python code to control the system using APIs provided by the  IoT Greenhouse Service software.
