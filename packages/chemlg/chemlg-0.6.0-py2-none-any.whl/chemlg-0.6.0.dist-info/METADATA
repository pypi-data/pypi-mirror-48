# ChemLG – A Library Generator for the Exploration and Enumeration of Chemical and Materials Spaces.
ChemLG is a smart and massive parallel molecular library generator for chemical and materials sciences.

Program Version: 0.3

Release Date: July 4, 2019

With contributions by:
Janhavi Abhay Dudwadkar (UB): Jupyter GUI

## Code Design:
ChemLG is developed in the Python 3 programming language and uses OpenBabel and its Python extension, Pybel for handling molecules. The development follows a strictly modular and object-oriented design to make the overall code as flexible and versatile as possible. ChemLG can be run on a single core or in parallel on multiple cores. For the parallel execution, MPI4Py is also required along with OpenBabel as dependencies of ChemLG.

## Documentation:
ChemLG documentation can be found here https://hachmannlab.github.io/chemlg

## Installation and Dependencies:
It is highly recommended that a virtual environment is used to run ChemLG. The virtual environment and ChemLG and its dependencies can be installed as:


    conda create --name my_chemlg_env python=3.6
    source activate my_chemlg_env
    conda install -c openbabel openbabel
    conda install -c anaconda mpi4py
    pip install chemlg

You can test the installation with:

    pytest -v
