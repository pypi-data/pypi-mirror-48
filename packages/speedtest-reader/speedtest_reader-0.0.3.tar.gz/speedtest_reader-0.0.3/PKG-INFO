        Selectively read file output generated by speedtest-cli
        
        
        Description
        ===========
        
        - Slices data into time frames.
        
        - Keeps data in RAM (append only) to reduce IO (for long-running processes).
        
        - Allows to select subsets of columns / keys (e.g. when reading large files).
        
        - Makes it easy to append additional timestamps via decorators (in formats
          required by matplotlib, plotly, dash, etc).
        
        
        TODO list (high priorities first)
        =================================
        
        - Review API function using mnemonics / shorthand.
        
        - Terminology cleanup in doc and docstrings.
        
        - Split up test scripts: from function-centric to topic-centric.
        
        - Complete extended timezone test cases.
        
        - Enable project to use CI (look at travis).
        
        - Backend:
        
          - Add ability to read json.
        
          - Extend API to allow selection of input columns (csv) / keys (json).
        
        - Assure compatibility with (at least newer) 2.x Python versions.
        
        - Assure this runs on earlier 3.x versions.
