        Description
        ===========
        
        - Slices data into time frames.
        
        - Keeps data in RAM (append only) to reduce IO (for long-running processes).
        
        - Allows to select subsets of columns / keys in data.
        
        - Can append additional timestamp types to data (via decorators in the API).
        
        
        TODO list (high priorities first)
        =================================
        
        - Review API Exception design.
        
        - Review API function using mnemonics / shorthand.
        
        - Terminology cleanup in doc and docstrings.
        
        - Complete extended timezone test cases.
        
        - Enable project to use CI (look a travis).
        
        - Backend:
        
          - Add ability to read json.
        
          - Extend API to allow selection of input columns (csv) / keys (json).
        
          - Add decorators for appending timestamps (e.g. time series in matplotlib).
        
        - Assure compatibility with (at least newer) 2.x Python versions.
        
        - Assure this runs on earlier 3.x versions.
