        ## What is this repository?
        
        Honeybee is a collection of Python library to create, run and visualize the results of
        daylight ([RADIANCE](https://radiance-online.org//)) and energy analysis
        ([EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/)/[OpenStudio](https://www.openstudio.net/)).
        
        This repository is the main repository for Honeybee core libraries. To extend the
        functionalities of this library you should install available Honeybee extensions or write
        your own. See [here](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-extension) to get started
        with writing your first extension.
        
        Here are a number of available extensions for Honeybee:
        
        - [honeybee-energy](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy): Adds Energy simulation to Honeybee.
