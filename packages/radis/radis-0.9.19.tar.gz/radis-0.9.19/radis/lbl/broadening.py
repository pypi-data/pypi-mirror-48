        Notes

        Implementation:

        - A broadening profile is calculated for each line, using the same
          wavenumber spacing as the calculated data. It is then applied to
          each line.

        - The broadening uses a `nearest` interpolation. It can induce an error
          if the wavenumber spacing is not small enough (I'd recommend ~ 10 wsteps
          per line FWHM). So far there is no automatic check that this criteria
          is applied.  # TODO

        Sizes of elements:

        - ``N``: number of lines in database part 'dg'  (only depends on the database)
            (typically: ~ 200 )
        - ``W``: size of wavelength array (the more the more accurate)
            (typically: ~ 10.000)
        - ``B``: restrained window over which we apply the convolution
            (typically: ~ 1000)

        Performance:

        - This function is the bottleneck in the whole Spectrum calculation. 
          Calculation is vectorized for most of the calculations (exp, `outer` ..), 
          but the execution of non vectorized functions, typically `argmin`,  roll` 
          and `convolve`, takes a long time.

          number density (cm-3) to get (cm-1/#) unit.

        Performances:

        This function is the bottleneck of the whole process. However, a fully
        vectorized version is impossible because it takes too much memory. Instead
        I used chunks of variable data length, and ended up parallelizing it.

        - loop version:                 1'53''
        - vectorized, 10 chunks:        1'30''
        - vectorized, 100 chunks:       1'11''
        - vectorized, 1000 chunks:      1'20''
        - vectorized, 10.000 chunks:    2'02''

        - parallel process 8 cpus:      33''

        - fully vectorized w/o roll etc... < 5'

        And then the parallel dispatching overhead becomes comparable with the
        process time, so better not use parallel anymore.

        continuum can be exported in Spectrum is using the ``self.export_continuum``
        boolean. This is not available as a User input but can be edited manually
        in the Factory.
        
        The Weak line characterization [1]_ is only based on abscoeff. For strong 
        nonequilibrium cases there may be lines consired as weak in terms 
        of absorption but not weaks in emission, or the other way around. It should
        be negligible, though, so a dual conditioning (looking at both abscoeff
        and emisscoeff) was not implemented.
