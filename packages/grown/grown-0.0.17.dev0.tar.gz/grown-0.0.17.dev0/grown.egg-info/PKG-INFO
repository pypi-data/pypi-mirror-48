Description: Grown
        =====
        
        Sensorbased plattform to create various tasks, apart from gathering data.
        The basic idea is to get a firmware for growing plants taking light and watering into a
        hand of a microcontroller.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Any Micropython board available or further anything which can run micropython.
        
        Installation
        ============
        Update and package installation will all be provided via upip.::
        
            import upip
            upip.install('grown')
        
        enabling the software and configuration is users choice.
        Like the webrepl in python is adding a call in your boot or main.py nesserary for activation
        like::
        
            from grown import setup, run_grown
        
            router = setup()
            # add more tasks or add site to the router
        
            run_grown()
        
        Setup of grown starts a timesync task and wlan configuration.
        After the run_grown a webserver is opened with a rest interface to change settings for each task.
