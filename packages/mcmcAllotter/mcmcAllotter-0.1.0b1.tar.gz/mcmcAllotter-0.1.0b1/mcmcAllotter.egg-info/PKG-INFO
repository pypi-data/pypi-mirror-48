Description: This is the source code for ["An MCMC Based Course to Teaching Assistant Allocation", S. Kumar, S. Moothedath, P. Chaporkar, M. Belur, Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Network, Communication and Computing (2016). ACM.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3033288.3033297)
            
            PS: The code is currently not optimized for performance and readability!
        
        #### Requirements:
        - Pandas
        - Numpy
        
        **Note**: Also I am working towards packaging this code. The packaging is complete although there are more refinements I'm making for performance and code readability.
