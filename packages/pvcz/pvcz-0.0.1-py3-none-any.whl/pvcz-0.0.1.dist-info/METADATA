# pvcz
This package provides the photovoltaic climate zones (PVCZ) and climate stressor data which describes the degree of environmental degradation expected on a PV module located in different locations on the world. 

The data is calcuated from the global land data accumulation service (GLDAS) at 0.25 degree resolution across the world.

For a full description, see the file 'Karin2019 - Photovoltaic Degradation Climate Zones - PVSC' which describes the methods.

## Climate stressors
This dataset is provided as a csv file and as a pickle file containing climate stressors specific to PV degradation.

- lat: latitude in fractional degrees.
