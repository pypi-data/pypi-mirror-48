# Py Filestore

This is a simple package meant to create a static data structure similar to a dictionary that exists as a group of files.

**If you have used any previous versions prior to 1.1.0, you should update as the last few updates changed how items were saved in the index and how things got hashed.**

#### Example usage
First, download it using pip:

    pip install py-filestore

Then:
```python
from filestore import Filestore
import requests

# You can pass your preferred encoding in:
# store = Filestore(encoding='ascii') # It defaults to utf-8
# You can also force overwriting on population with
# store = Filestore(overwrite=True)
store = Filestore()

# You can treat this just like a python dictionary!
# You can populate it in two ways:
store['a'] = (1,2,3) 
store.append(('b', "The alphabet is pretty cool"))
store[1] = [13.23, 321.0]
# You can store any data that is supported by python's own
# pickle package. 
store['res'] = requests.get("https://api.github.com/")
# And if you have data that is not supported, you can write
# and set your own serializer and deserializer for it.

print(store)
# {'a': '(1, 2, 3)', 'b': 'The alphabet is pretty cool', 'res': '<Response [200]>', 1: [13.23, 321.0]}

# You can get items out too!
alpha = store['a']
print(alpha)
# (1, 2, 3)
print(alpha[1])
# 2

# The dictionary is saved to file under the directory ./.store
# which means you can close the session and return for it later
# as long as the working directory is the same when the class is initialized.
# However, this leaves residue on the file system. We can clean that up too!
store.clean_up() # All the saved data is gone now.
```



#### How it works:
Creating an instance of the class will create a directory on the system that will hold all the given information. An index file is created to allow repopulation over different sessions. 

When data is added to the *filestore*, the class hashes the key with a naive, non-cryptographic hashing algorithm called [FNV-1a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash) in 32 bits. This hash becomes the name of the file. Collisions are now handled in the case that they occur!

 The actual data gets serialized with python's [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) and then encoded into base64 before being written to the disk. If your data is not compatible with [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), you can write and assign your own serializer/deserializer using `store.set_serializer(my_serializer_function)` and `store.set_deserializer(my_deserializer_function)` prior to inserting or removing data.

 #### Tests
 Currently, the testing.py file is not comprehensive and tests random strings of a specific length for collisions. It could use some work, but it does prove that [FNV-1a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash) has collisions if you look hard enough.
