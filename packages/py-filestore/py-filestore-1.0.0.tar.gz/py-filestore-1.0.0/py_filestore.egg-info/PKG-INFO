Description: # Py Filestore
        
        This is a simple package meant to create a static data structure similar to a dictionary that exists as a group of files.
        
        #### Example usage
        ```python
        from filestore import Filestore
        
        # You can pass your preferred encoding in:
        # store = Filestore(encoding='ascii') # It defaults to utf-8
        # You can also force overwriting on population with
        # store = Filestore(overwrite=True)
        store = Filestore()
        
        # You can treat this just like a python dictionary!
        # You can populate it in two ways:
        store['a'] = (1,2,3) 
        store.append(('b', "The alphabet is pretty cool"))
        
        print(store)
        # >>> {'a': '(1, 2, 3)', 'b': 'The alphabet is pretty cool'}
        
        # You can get items out too!
        alpha = store['a']
        print(alpha)
        # >>> (1, 2, 3)
        print(alpha[1])
        # >>> 2
        
        # The dictionary is saved to file under the directory ./.store
        # which means you can close the session and return for it later
        # as long as the working directory is the same when the class is initialized.
        # However, this leaves residue on the file system. We can clean that up too!
        store.clean_up() # All the saved data is gone now.
        ```
        
        #### How it works:
        Creating an instance of the class will create a directory on the system that will hold all the given information. An index file is created to allow repopulation over different sessions. 
        
        When data is added to the *filestore*, the class hashes the key with a naive, non-cryptographic hashing algorithm called [FNV-1a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash) in 32 bits. This hash becomes the name of the file. **I have no proof that collisions are completely handled yet.**
        
         The actual data gets serialized with python's [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) and then encoded into base64 before being written to the disk. If your data is not compatible with [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), you can write and assign your own serializer/deserializer using `store.set_serializer(my_serializer_function)` and `store.set_deserializer(my_deserializer_function)` prior to inserting or removing data.
        
         #### Tests
         Currently, the testing .py file is not comprehensive and tests random strings of a specific length for collisions. It could use some work, but it does prove that [FNV-1a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash) has collisions if you look hard enough.
