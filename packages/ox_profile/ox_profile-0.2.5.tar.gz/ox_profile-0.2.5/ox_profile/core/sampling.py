class Sampler(object):
    """Basic class to sample program for statistical profiling.

This is the workhorse for ox_profile to do statistical sampling.
At a low level, we do this sampling using `sys._current_frames`. As
suggested by the leading underscore, this system function may be a bit
less robust. Indeed, the documentation says "This function should be
used for specialized purposes only." Hopefully the core python
developers will not make major changes to such a useful function.

The most interesting method is `run` which:

  1. Uses `sys.setswitchinterval` to try and prevent a thread context switch.
  2. Calls `sys._current_frames` to sample what the python interpreter is
     doing.
  3. Updates a simple in-memory database of what functions are running.

In principle, you could just use the Sampler via something like

>>> from ox_profile.core import sampling, recording
>>> sampler = sampling.Sampler(recording.CountingRecorder())
>>> def foo():
...     sampler.run()
...     return 'done'
...
>>> dummy = foo()
>>> info, calls = sampler.my_db.query()
>>> pretty = ('%c'%10).join(map(str, info))
>>> print('%i calls:%c%s' % (calls, 10, pretty)) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
1 calls:
ProfileRecord(...)

The above would have the sampler take a snapshot of the stack frames
when the `foo` function is run. Of course, this isn't very useful by
itself because it just tells you that `foo` is being run. It could be
useful if there were other threads which were running because the
sampler would tell you what stack frame those threads were in. For
this reason you should use the SimpleLauncher class in
the `ox_profile/core/launchers` module which creates an instance
of this class.
