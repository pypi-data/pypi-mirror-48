Description: # Farmer
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmfarms/farmer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmfarms/farmer)
        
        Use `farmer` to deploy your applications on [VM Farms](https://vmfarms.com/).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install with pip:
        
        ```
        pip install farmer
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        You need to provide Farmer with your VM Farms API token. You can retrieve your API token from the [API documentation section](https://my.vmfarms.com/api/) of the VM Farms portal.
        
        Run `farmer config` to set your token for the first time:
        
        ```
        farmer config
        ```
        
        If you need to change your token for any reason, you can use `farmer config set token`:
        
        ```
        farmer config set token c422b5e2230d617d22759a19a5a5cb65792edebc
        ```
        
        You can also set the token using the `FARMER_TOKEN` environment variable:
        
        ```
        FARMER_TOKEN=c422b5e2230d617d22759a19a5a5cb65792edebc farmer apps
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### `farmer apps`
        
        Run `farmer apps` to list your  applications.
        
        ```
        farmer apps
        ```
        
        If you don't see any applications, we probably need to connect a few wires for you. Contact our [support team](mailto:support@vmfarms.com) and we'll sort you out.
        
        ### `farmer deploy`
        
        Run `farmer deploy` to deploy an application:
        
        ```
        farmer deploy api api-prod
        ```
        
        ### `farmer logdna`
        
        Export logs from [LogDNA](https://logdna.com/) in [JSONLines format](http://jsonlines.org/).
        
        First, generate a [service key](https://app.logdna.com/manage/profile) and configure Farmer:
        
        ```
        farmer logdna config
        ```
        
        To export logs, run `farmer logdna export`.
        You can filter results by application, host, log level, or a custom search query.
        
        ```
        # Export all PostgreSQL logs from the past week.
        farmer logdna export --from 'last week' --app postgres
        
        # Export deploy logs from today.
        farmer logdna export --app deploy
        ```
        
        The `-f`/`--from` and `-t`/`--to` options support human readable dates like "1 hour ago", "30 minutes ago", "yesterday", etc.
        Refer to the [dateparser documentation](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.
        
        ## Getting help
        
        To get help for a specific command or subcommand, run `farmer help`:
        
        ```
        farmer help deploy
        ```
        
        ```
        farmer help logdna config
        ```

        ## Tricks
        
        Add this snippet to your Bash configuration (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`) to enable tab-completion:
        
        ```shell
        eval "$(_FARMER_COMPLETE=source farmer)"
        ```
        
        Enjoy!
