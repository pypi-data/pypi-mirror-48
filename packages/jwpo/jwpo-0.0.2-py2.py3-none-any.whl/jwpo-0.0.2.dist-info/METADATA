Notes
-----

- Program

  - Inputs: Tex File, Gradebook File, Opportunity Number, Opportunity Name,
    Directory

  - Outputs: Dozens of PDFs

  - Write it defensively, catch errors early.

  - Make sure it works on Windows.

- TeX File

  - A1.1 -- Outcome, Type, Variant -- Label

  - Outcome: single character

  - Type: single digit integer

  - Variant: single digit integer

  - Variant maps to Opportunity

  - Introduction

    - Preamble is start of file to "%Start questions" line.

  - Student Name

    - Replace "studentName" with "First Last" of student.

  - Opportunity Name

    - Ask for opportunity name (text) and fill in for "opportunityName".

  - Math Seed

    - Jared: each item needs to have its seed set explicitly if needed.

  - Number of Opportunity

    - Jared: renumber labels so that variant corresponds to opportunity number.

    - Ask for opportunity number (integer).

  - Structure/Format

    - Delete questions not matching opportunity/gradebook.

    - Remove variant identifier ".X".

  - Identify Items

    - Start with "\item[A1.1:]"

    - End with any of next item, or math set seed, or 

  - Horizontal Rule

    - Only to occur between intro and outcome sections.

  - Outcome Header

    - Identified by "{\bf ...}"

    - Only to occur at start of outcomes given to students.

- Gradebook

  - Focus on MergeData sheet.

  - Student name is "[Nickname] [Last Name]"

  - Identifying Opportunities

    - Opportunity 1 is all green (automatically given)

    - Opportunity 2 is all blue (automatically given)

      - And some will see some of the green.

    - U outcome in Gradebook maps to F outcome in TeX File

    - Opportunity 3 is all yellow (automatically given)

      - J outcome does not map to TeX File (it's a project)

    - Gray-colored outcomes should be ignored (it's a project)

  - Identifying Columns

    - Ignore "AL" (Outcome-Letter "L") total of other columns.

    - First question has value 2, 1, or 0.

    - Second and third questions has value 1 or 0.

    - The "W" column has value 1 or 0.

  - Logic for Questions

    - When the opportunity matches, then auto-given.

    - Else, when "W" column is 1 and question is not max, then given.

      - Outcomes that qualify must have been given in a previous opportunity.

    - Opportunities 5 and 6 have no auto-given questions.

  - Ordering

    - It's OK for opportunities to be displayed in original order.

- Open Questions

  - How to map "blue" columns to Opportunity 1?

    - These are the auto-given questions.

    - Idea: Add spreadsheet with opportunity to outcome mapping.
