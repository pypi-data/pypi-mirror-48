        ## Code Examples
        `drgpy` is really simple to use. 
        Please see some examples below.
        NOTE that all functions used below have docstrings. 
        If you want to see the input parameter specifications,
        please type `print(<instance>.<function>.__doc__)`.
        
        ```python
        >>> from drgpy.msdrg import DRGEngine
        >>> de = DRGEngine()
        >>> print(de.get_drg.__doc__)
        
                Return the corresponding DRG code for the diagnoses and procedures
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                dx_lst : list
                        A list of ICD-10 diagnosis codes
                pr_lst : list
                        A list of ICD-10 procedure codes
        >>>
        >>> de.get_drg(["B20"],[])
        '977'
        >>> de.get_drg([], ["02HA0RS"])
        '983'
        >>> de.get_drg([], ["02HA0RS", "02PA0RZ"])
        '002'
        >>>
        ```
