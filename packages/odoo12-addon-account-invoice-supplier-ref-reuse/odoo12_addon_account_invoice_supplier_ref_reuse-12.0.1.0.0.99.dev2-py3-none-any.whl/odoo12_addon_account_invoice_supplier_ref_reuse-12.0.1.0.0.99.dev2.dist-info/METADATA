=================================
Reuse Supplier Invoice References
=================================

In some cases, having more than one supplier invoice with the same
reference is possible. For instance, in Switzerland, BVR/ESR numbers
are used as a type of reference. Generally, this number is unique and
used only for one invoice. However, some suppliers do use the same BVR
reference for several invoices (usually for recurring invoices).
