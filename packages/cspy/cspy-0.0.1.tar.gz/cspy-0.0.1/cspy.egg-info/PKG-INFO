Description: cspy
        ====
        
        A collection of algorithms for the (resource) Constrained Shortest Path problem.
        
        The algorithms implemented include:
        
         - [X] Monodirectional forward labeling algorithm;
         - [X] Monodirectional backward labeling algorithm;
         - [X] Bidirectional labeling algorithm with static halfway point;
         - [X] Bidirectional labeling algorithm with dynamic halfway point [1];
         - [X] Heuristic Tabu search [2].
        
        Features implemented include: generic resource extension functions (not restricted to additive resources), generic resource consumptions (not restricted to non-negative values), and, increased efficiency (when compared to other implementations of monodirectional algorithms) [3].
