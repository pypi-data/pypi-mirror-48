# bluemax

bluemax is a python rpc server using websockets.

The concept is that you can write python functions and
expose them in the `__all__` property of the module.

The complexity comes when you want to do more than
this. And that is what I am working on. The most
important pattern to me is being able to insert, update
and delete in the database and be able to broadcast
the changes to all users after the actor gets their
response. I call it broadcast_on_success.

        actor   crud    broadcast
          |       |         |
          |------>|         |
          |       |         |
          |<------|         |
          |       |-------->|
          |       |         |
          |<------|---------|
          |       |         |

  The errors from crud are local to the actor. The actor
  will recieve identity on success and then like every
  other user hear about crud via broadcast.

  Using annotations allows clients to
  infer function. See the sample.add function.

For deployment of mutiple servers see:

  http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/running.html#running-behind-a-load-balancer

To use:
```
pip install bluemax
```

To install:
```
python3.7 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -e git+https://bitbucket.org/blueshed/bluemax.git#egg=bluemax
```

To run you can choose either with workers using redis or standalone.

To run standalone:
```
runmax server -m bluemax.sample
```

To run with redis:
```
pip install bluemax[redis]
docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:2.8
```

Then create a .env file containing:
```
redis_url="redis://localhost/0"
```
Then run a worker in one terminal
and a server in the another.
```
runmax worker -m bluemax.sample
```
and
```
runmax server -m bluemax.sample
```

Now go to http://localhost:8080 and add some numbers.

To build your own project try:
```
runmax startproject foo
```
You can use any name for your module. It will create extension points for both
settings and urls and a base procedures modules. runmax will look for your
procedures.__all__ in the -m module you pass in.

To release:
```
invoke bump-version --confirm patch
pip install -e .[dev]
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
```
