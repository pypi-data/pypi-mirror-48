        ### Installation
        Install from pip
        
        ### Extending BaseClient
        If you are looking to extend BaseClient and implement your own behaviour / set of endpoints, please remember to implement the following:
        - `close` - a way of tidying up any open files or the event loop
        - `on_event` - If you do not want events, this can just `pass`, but if you do then you must handle them accordingly. The only argument passed is data, a dictionary created from Discord's event structure. You must be subscribed to receive these.
