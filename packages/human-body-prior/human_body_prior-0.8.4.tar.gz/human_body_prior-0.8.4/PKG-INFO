Description: # VPoser: Variational Human Pose Prior
        ![alt text](github_data/vposer_samples.png "Novel Human Poses Sampled From the VPoser.")
        ## Description
        The articulated 3D pose of the human body is high-dimensional and complex. 
        Many applications make use of a prior distribution over valid human poses, but modeling this distribution is difficult.
        Here we provide a learned distribution trained from a large dataset of human poses represented as SMPL bodies.
        
        Here we present a method that is used in [SMPLify-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/). 
        Our variational human pose prior, named VPoser, has the following features: 
         - defines a prior of SMPL pose parameters
         - is end-to-end differentiable
         - provides a way to penalize impossible poses while admitting valid ones
         - effectively models correlations among the joints of the body
         - introduces an efficient, low-dimensional, representation for human pose
         - can be used to generate valid 3D human poses for data-dependent tasks

        ## Installation
        
        To install the model:
        1. To install from PyPi simply run: 
          ```bash
          pip install human_body_prior
          ```
        2. Clone this repository and install it using the *setup.py* script: 
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/nghorbani/human_body_prior
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Loading Trained Models
        
        To download the trained *VPoser*  models go to the [SMPL-X project website](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/) and register to get access to the downloads section. Afterwards, you can follow the [model loading tutorial](human_body_prior/tutorials/README.md) to load and use your trained VPoser models.
        
        ## Train VPoser
        We train VPoser, using a [variational autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)
        that learns a latent representation of human pose and regularizes the distribution of the latent code to be a normal distribution.
        We train our prior on data from the [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/) dataset; 
        specifically, the SMPL pose parameters of various publicly available human motion capture datasets. 
        You can follow the [data preparation tutorial](human_body_prior/data/README.md) to learn how to download and prepare AMASS for VPoser.
        Afterwards, you can [train VPoser from scratch](human_body_prior/train/README.md).
