        ## Installation
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        * [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.5 or higher
        * [Zivid SDK](https://zivid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZividKB/pages/59080712/Zivid+Software+Installation) version 1.3.0 or higher
        * [Compiler](doc/CompilerInstallation.md) with C++17 support
        
        *Windows users also needs to make sure that the Zivid SDK installation folder is in system `PATH` before using the package, not only the terminal PATH variable. The default install location that should be added to system `PATH` is `C:\Program Files\Zivid\bin`.*
        
        ### Using PIP
        
        The easiest way to install the package is to use PIP.
        
        When using PIP version 19 or higher build dependencies will be handled automatically.
        
        #### Old PIP
        
        If you are using a version of PIP older than version 19 please manually install the dependencies listed in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) before installing the zivid package.
        
            pip install scikit-build cmake ninja
        
        Installation of the zivid package may take some time since the `setup.py` script will download additional dependencies and compile C++ source code in the background.
        
            pip install zivid
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        Launch a Python interpreter and run the following code.
        
            import zivid
            app = zivid.Application()
            camera = app.connect_camera()
            frame = camera.capture()
            frame.save("my-frame.zdf")
        
        For more advanced usage see the [Examples](#examples) section.
        
        ### Using camera emulation
        
        If you do not have a camera, you can use the `MiscObjects.zdf` file in [ZividSampleData.zip](http://www.zivid.com/software/ZividSampleData.zip) to emulate a camera.
        
            import zivid
            app = zivid.Application()
            camera = app.create_file_camera("path/to/MiscObjects.zdf")
            frame = camera.capture()
            frame.save("my-frame.zdf")
        
        ## Examples
        
        Standalone example programs can be found in the [samples](samples) directory.
        
        ## Versioning
        
        This python module is using [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440) for versioning. The features available in the module depends on the Zivid SDK version used  when building the module. When updating this Python package it is *reccomended* to also update to the latest [Zivid SDK](http://www.zivid.com/software). Refer to the [Test Matrix](#test-matrix) for supported version.
