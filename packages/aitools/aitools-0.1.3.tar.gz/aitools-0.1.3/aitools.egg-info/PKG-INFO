        Features
        --------
        
        * N-GRAM
        
            * Predict the next word of the sentence that further can be use for predicting the entire sentence.
            * Generation of text like a paragraph/article on Health or environment or any other topic (given relevant data).
            * Generation of the next GOT books!!!.
        
            * Next Phase - Use of bayesian statistics and more nice probability models for getting the best results.
        
        Look For: Demo file n_gram.py
        
        * K-MEANS
        
            * Creates clusters and classify new nodes into those clusters.
            * Efficient and easy to implement.
        
            * Next Phase - Multiple algorithms implementation.
        
        Look For: Demo file k_means.py and k_means_color_cluster.py
        
        * Logistic Regression
        
            * From probability of event happening or not to the next Data point, it is a very versatile algorithm.
            * Simple Implementation and Training routines.
            * Uses Gradient Descent and Sigmoid Function.
        
            * Next Phase - Improvements in Gradient Descent is still in progress.
        
        Look For: Demo file logistic_regression.py
        
        * Naive Bayes
        
            * Algorithm based on Bayesian statistics, which is capable of creating classifications like an intent classifier or sentiment analysis engine(A true complex one not the Pathetic Twitter thing).
            * Created using little bit of probability and bayesian statistics with a hint of programming and with a lot of love.
        
            * Next Phase - Flexibility and more control on different algorithm.
        
        Look For: Demo file naive_bayes.py
        
        * Decision Tree
        
            * Algorithm based on Gini logic and info gain for prediction.
            * Trees can be very use full but may lead to aver fitting easily Be Cautious.
        
            * Next Phase - Flexibility and more control on different algorithm.
        
        Look For: Demo file decision_tree.py
        
        * Pre Processing
        
            * Utils for Pre Processing Data.
        
            * Next Phase - More Cool Functions.
        
        Look For: Demo file pre_processing.py
        
        * Others
        
            * In build Mathematics Util.
                * Vector Math, Probability, and some Statistic
                * Util will be upgraded as per the need.
            * Gradient Descent.
                * Entire Gradient Descent algorithm combined into one.
                * Usability Docs will be Provided Soon.
        
        * Next Updates
        
            * Improving all algorithms and giving proper documentation on usage.
            * Providing more user control on algorithm selection and output handling.
            * Detailed Demo files.
            * Sudo codes and algorithm explanations.
            * Will be available to lower version( > 2.7).
