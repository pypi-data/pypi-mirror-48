        A standalone version of pyCoalesce can be found at:
        https://pypi.org/project/pyCoalesce/
        
        To install pyCoalesce via pip, simply "pip install pyCoalesce".
        
        The "lxml" package is recommended for manipulating XSD-based classes, but
        it's not absolutely required.
        
        
        The full Coalesce project can be found at:
        https://github.com/InCadence/coalesce
        
        The pyCoalesce version number corresponds to the Coalesce version number, but 
        is modified to meet PEP 440 and PyPi rules:  release version numbers are 
        identical, but for snapshot versions, "snapshot" is replaced with "preX", where
        "X" is a sequential number incremented whenever a pyCoalesce snapshot is
        distributed.
        
        The pyCoalesce package is found in the "pyCoalesce" directory of the Coalesce
        repository.  In addition to the pyCoalesce source files, this directory and its
        sub-directories contain documentation (and source for creating documentation), a
        script for generating classes from the the Coalesce entity XSD, tests, and 
        distribution tools.
        
        The "unit tests" are not true unit tests:  later tests rely on the entities
        created in earlier tests, thereby avoiding either repeated creation and 
        deletion of entities, or testing against a mocked-up API.  (The latter would
        be unnecessarily time-consuming to create, and wouldn't catch bugs in the API
        itself, which was still a consideration when this wrapper was created.)
        
        To recreate the distribution files, run the following command from this 
        directory (typical options have been included):
        
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
