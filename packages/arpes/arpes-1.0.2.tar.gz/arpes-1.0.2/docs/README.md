Installation
============

The simplest way to install the package is using pip. While this
repository is private, you can install with pip by pointing pip to the
URL of the repository as:

```bash
pip install --process-dependency-links -e
```

Once this project is published on PyPI, you can install by using

```bash
pip install --process-dependency-links pypes
```

You will need to install into a Python interpreter with version 3.5 or
higher. Note that the [\--process-dependency-links]{.title-ref}
directive appears in both commands and is necessary in order to include
a patched version of the Igor interop library.

Alternative Installation
========================

If for whatever reason you do not want to install the project as a
package but would like to import it locally, legacy install instructions
are available in the first section of `README.legacy.rst`.

This can be advantageous if you want to frequently change the package
source without reinstalling. A further alternative is to clone the
package and `pip install` from the local folder, which has the advantage
of a simple installation procedure and puts the code someplace easily
editable.

Additional Suggested Steps
--------------------------

1.  Clone or duplicate the folder structure in the repository
    `arpes-analysis-scaffold`, skipping the example folder and data if
    you like
2.  Install and configure standard tools like
    [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or Jupyter Lab. Notes on installing
    and configuring Jupyter based installations can be found in
    `jupyter.md`
3.  Explore the documentation and example notebooks at [the
    documentation site](https://stupefied-bhabha-ce8a9f.netlify.com/).

`local_config.py`
-----------------

The local configuration allows you to override the settings that are
committed to the repository and therefore shared. You can use this to as
adjust settings on various interactive tools. For reference, Conrad's
looks like:

```python
SETTINGS = {
    'interactive': {
        'main_width': 600,
        'marginal_width': 300,
        'palette': 'magma',
    },
}
```

IPython Kernel Customization
----------------------------

If you don't want to have to import everything all the time, you should
customize your IPython session so that it runs imports when you first
spin up a kernel. There are good directions for how to do this online,
but a short version is:

1.  Create an IPython profile, use this to start your notebooks
2.  In `~/.ipython/profile_default/` make a folder `startup`
3.  Add the files
    `~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/00-add-arpes-path.py` and
    `~/.ipython/{Your profile}/startup/01-common-imports.ipy` according
    to the templates in `ipython_templates`. See in particular note
    above about setting the environment variable using this file.
4.  Customize

It is important that the filenames you put are such that
`00-add-arpes-path` is lexographically first, as this ensures that it is
executed first. The `.ipy` extension on `01-common-imports.ipy` is also
essential. Ask Conrad if any of this is confusing.
