<h1>wsgiAdaptor API</h1>
  <p id="subject">API for a simple WSGI web framework</p>
  <div><h2>wsgiAdaptor</h2>
<p>This class provides a basic web development framework that should work with any WSGI implementation.</p>
<h3>wsgiAdaptor (applicationObject, cookieKey, sessionClient)</h3>
<p>The wsgiAdaptor object provides a basic web development environment within an WSGI server implementation.</p>
<ul>
	<li>applicationObject - An object that provides a method <code>requestHandler (request)</code>.&nbsp; The requestHandler method must be multi-thread safe and return no value.&nbsp; The requestHandler is passed a Request object which contains details of the request, and provides methods to return content to the client.</li>
	<li>cookieKey - A secret key that is used to sign all outgoing cookies.&nbsp; This is used to detect when a client has modified or created a cookie in order to protect against session high-jacking.</li>
	<li>sessionClient - A <a href="wsgi-session-client-api.html">session client</a> object that provides the ability to save and load session data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>wsgiHook (environment, start_response)</h3>
<p>The method that the WSGI implementation should call.</p>
<h2>Request</h2>
<p>An instance of this class is passed to the application's <code>requsetHandler</code> method for every request made of the application.&nbsp; If no "sendX" method is called before the handler returns then an Internal Server Error is sent to the client.&nbsp; The sendX methods can be called multiple times with only the last method called taking effect.</p>
<h3>getFormFields()</h3>
<p>Returns a FieldStorage instance containing the GET or POST variables (see the Python standard libraries CGI module for more information).</p>
<h3>getSession()</h3>
<p>Returns the session associated with this client.&nbsp; The session is a Mapping type (e.g. dictionary).&nbsp; Values added to the session will automatically be saved into the session.&nbsp; Be aware that as the size of the session increases the time taken to load and save the session will grow.</p>
<h3>getUsername()</h3>
<p>The username of the authenticated user, or None if the user provided no username.</p>
<h3>getPassword()</h3>
<p>The password used by the user to authenticate, None if no authentication is provided.</p>
<h3>getErrorStream()</h3>
<p>Returns the stream that applications errors should be written to.</p>
<h3>getRelativePath()</h3>
<p>Return the relative path (still URL escaped) that was passed to the application.</p>
<h3>getURLPrefix()</h3>
<p>Returns the part of the URL up to the parameters (e.g http://server.com/scriptName.py).</p>
<h3>sendContent (contentValue, contentType = "text/plain")</h3>
<p>Set the content to be sent to the client once the application returns.&nbsp; If the content is not plain text then the contentType should be specified as the second parameter.</p>
<h3>sendUnauthorisedBasic (realm)</h3>
<p>Prompt the user for a username/password for the given realm.</p>
<h3>sendSeeOtherRedirect (newDestination)</h3>
<p>Send a 303 HTTP redirect to the newDestination.</p>
<h3>sendResponse (responseStr, contentValue, contentType = "text/plain")</h3>
<p>Set the response and content to be sent to the client once the application returns.&nbsp; The responseStr should be the HTTP response string, e.g. "500 Internal Error".</p>
<h3>sendFileForPath (path, rootDir = None)</h3>
<p>Sets the content and contentType to be sent to the client based on the contents of a file for the given path.&nbsp; The path should be URL escaped.&nbsp; rootDir is the directory that the path is relative too, taking the current working directory if none is provided.</p>
<p>If the path reaches outside of the rootDir (e.g. a path of '../../etc/passwd') then an IOError is thrown.&nbsp; No other security checking is performed.</p>
