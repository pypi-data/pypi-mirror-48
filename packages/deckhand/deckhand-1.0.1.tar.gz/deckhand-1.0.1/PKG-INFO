        ## Usage
        
        ### Installation
        
        The recommended way to install Deckhand is from our private release repository. This will ensure that you have the latest working version. If your project requires you to modify deckhand, you can always install from source.
        
        ##### From Private Repository:
        
        1. If you have Python 3 with pip installed, just run: `pip3 install deckhand --extra-index-url https://pypi.mindcloud.tools/oceanstack/release/+simple/`
        
        ##### From PyPi:
        
        1. `pip3 install deckhand`
        
        ##### From source:
        
        1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://mindcloud.dev/oceanstack/deckhand/deckhand.git`
        2. Change directories: `cd deckhand/`
        3. Run the installer with Python 3: `python3 setup.py install`
        
        ### Using Deckhand
