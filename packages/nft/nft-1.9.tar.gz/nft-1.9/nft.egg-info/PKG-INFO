        A python script for quickly ceating a **N**\ ew **F**\ ile form a
        **T**\ emplate
        
        Installing
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Simply clone this repository into a directory that you won't
        accidentally delete or move. I would recommend putting it in ~/ .
        Navigate to the newly created directory can run the following commands:
        
        ::
        
            $ chmod a+x ./install
            $ ./install
        
        This will prompt you with a few commands to fill out the templates with
        your information. In order to source your bash profile, it'll ask you to
        login again. If this makes you uncomfortable, you can '^C' and run the
        source command manually with:
        
        ::
        
            $ source ~/.bash_profile
        
        Running
        ~~~~~~~
        
        Just like that, we should be in business. Now work something like the
        Touch command but instead of creating empty files, when Will create
        basic boilerplate files from the template. Try it out with something
        like:
        
        ::
        
            $ nft test.java
        
        Which created the folowing file:
        
        ::

            import java.util.*;
            import java.lang.*;
            import java.io.*;
        
            public class test
            {
                    public static void main(String args[])
                    {
                            System.out.println("New Java file created from template")
                    }
            }
        
        Other File Types
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        NFT can also build non-source files. The standard README is included in
        the templates and he can be run with:
        
        ::
        
            $ nft README
        
        But the real coup de grace is the makefiles. NFT can build makefiles for
        Java and C projects and can even make a jar package. NFT will compile
        files beforehand to catch any nested classes that don't correspond .java
        files. Run the makefile script with:
        
        ::
        
            $ nft Makefile
        
        Adding Templates
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Also not as simple as the install, adding templates it's quite easy. In
        new\_from\_template.py you'll find a dictionary called file\_types. Add
        an entry to the dictionary with the key (language name) and value (file
        extention). Next, in the ./templates sub-directory add a file named ..
        For instance if you wanted to add a C++ template, you could do something
        like:
        
        ::
        
            file_types[C++]=cpp
        
        Using the other templates as a reference, add specific replace wildcards
        for the program i.e. .

        CAUTION
        ^^^^^^^
        
            As with any install from source, it is important to read it over and
            I understand what the code is doing. Pay special attention bash
            scripts as well as any process calls in the Python scripts i.e.
            Popen, open, write or subproces. By design, this program will edit
            system files so if you don't understand what a command is doing,
            check the docs.
