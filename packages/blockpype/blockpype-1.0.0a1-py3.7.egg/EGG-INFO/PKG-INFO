Description: # Blockpype
        
        Breaks apart input stream into blocks and pipes each block into newly spawned processes
        
        ## Installing
        
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/kfzteile24/blockpype.git
        ```
        
        ## Testing
        Clone the repository and run visual tests that display each started PID and their output:
        * `test/by-byte.sh` - should break apart in the middle of the 2-byte character
        * `test/by-char.sh` - should break apart in the middle of some numbers
        * `test/by-line.sh` - should break apart nicely line by line
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        cat content.txt | blockpype -l 10 other-program --arg-for-program --another-arg "argument value"
        ```
        
        It will cut `content.txt` into blocks of 10 lines, and for each block, a process will be started using the command:
        
        ```
        other-program --arg-for-program --another-arg "argument value"
        ```
        
        and the contents of the block will be served to *stdin*
        
        ## What's it for?
        
        Whenever you want to break apart a large stream when the `other-program` consumer stores it into memory until EOF, and you don't have enough memory for it.
        
        Similar to `split --filter "other-program --arg-for-program --another-arg \"argument value\""` except less clunky, `other-program` gets launched from current `pwd` with the current user, and with the current environment variables.
