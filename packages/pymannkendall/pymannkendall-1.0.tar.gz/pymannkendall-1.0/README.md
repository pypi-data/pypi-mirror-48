pyMannkendal is a pure Python implementation of non-parametric Mann Kendall trend analysis. Currently, this package has 11 Mann-Kendall Tests and 2 sen's slope estimator function. Brief description of functions are below:

1.	**Original Mann Kendall test (*original_test*):** Original Mann Kendall test [@mann1945nonparametric; @kendall1975rank] is a nonparametric test, which does not consider serial correlation or seasonal effects.

2.	**Hamed and Rao Modified MK Test (*hamed_rao_modification_test*):** This modified MK test proposed by Hamed and Rao [@hamed1998modified] to address serial autocorrelation issues. (Their) They suggested variance correction approach to improve trend analysis. User can consider first n significant lag by insert lag number in this function. By default, it considered all significant lags.

3.	**Yue and Wang Modified MK Test (*yue_wang_modification_test*):** This is also a variance correction method for considered serial autocorrelation proposed by Yue, S., & Wang, C. Y. (2004) [@yue2004mann]. User can also set their desired significant n lags for the calculation.

4.	**Modified MK test using Pre-Whitening method (*pre_whitening_modification_test*):** This test suggested by Yue and Wang (2002) [@yue2002applicability] to using Pre-Whitening the time series prior to the application of trend test.

5.	**Modified MK test using Trend free Pre-Whitening method (*trend_free_pre_whitening_modification_test*):** This test also proposed by Yue and Wang (2002) [@yue2002influence] to remove trend component and then Pre-Whitening the time series prior to application of trend test.

6.	**Multivariate MK Test (*multivariate_test*):** This is an MK test for multiple parameters proposed by Hirsch (1982) [@hirsch1982techniques]. Actually, he used this method for seasonal mk test, where he considered every month is a parameter.

7.	**Seasonal MK Test (*seasonal_test*):** For seasonal time series data, Hirsch, R.M., Slack, J.R. and Smith, R.A. (1982) [@hirsch1982techniques] proposed this test to calculate the seasonal trend.

8.	**Regional MK Test (*regional_test*):** Based on Hirsch (1982) [@hirsch1982techniques] proposed seasonal mk test, Helsel, D.R. and Frans, L.M., (2006) [@helsel2006regional] suggest regional mk test to calculate overall trend a regional scale.

9.	**Correlated Multivariate MK Test (*correlated_multivariate_test*):** This multivariate mk test proposed by Hipel (1994) [@hipel1994time] for when parameters are correlated.

10.	**Correlated Seasonal MK Test (*correlated_seasonal_test*):** This method proposed by Hipel (1994) [@hipel1994time] used, when time series significantly correlated with the preceding one or more months/seasons.

11.	**Partial MK Test (*partial_test*):** In a real event, many factors are affecting the main studied response parameter, which can bias the trend results. To overcome this problem, Libiseller (2002) [@libiseller2002performance] proposed this partial mk test. It required two parameters as input, where, one is response parameter and other is an independent parameter.

12.	**Theilâ€“sen's Slope Estimator (*sens_slope*):** This method proposed by Theil (1950) [@theil1950rank] and Sen (1968) [@sen1968estimates] to estimate the magnitude of the monotonic trend.

13.	**Seasonal sen's Slope Estimator (*seasonal_sens_slope*):** This method proposed by Hipel (1994) [@hipel1994time] to estimate the magnitude of the monotonic trend, when data has seasonal effects.

# Function details:

All Mann-kendall test functions has almost similer input parameters. Those are:

- **x**:   a vector of data
- **alpha**: significance level (0.05 default)
- **lag**: No. of First Significant Lags (Only available in hamed_rao_modification_test and yue_wang_modification_test)
- **period**: seasonal cycle. For monthly data it is 12, weekly data it is 52 (Only available in seasonal tests)

And all Mann-kendall tests return a named tuple which contained:

- **trend**: tells the trend (increasing, decreasing or no trend)
- **h**: True (if trend is present) or False (if trend is absence)
- **p**: p value of the significance test
- **z**: normalized test statistics
- **Tau**: Kendall Tau
- **s**: Mann-Kendal's score
- **var_s**: Variance S
- **slope**: sen's slope

sen's slope function required data vector. seasonal sen's slope also has optional input period, which by default value is 12. Both sen's slope function return only slope value.

# Installation

You can install pyMannKendall using pip.

```python
pip install pymannkendall
```

Or you can clone the repo and install it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmhs013/pymannkendall
cd pymannkendall
python setup.py install
```

# Usage

Here an example of `pyMannKendall` usage:
```python
import numpy as np
import pymannkendall as mk

# Data generation for analysis
data = np.random.rand(360,1)

result = mk.original_test(data)
print(result)
```
Output are like this:
```python
Mann_Kendall_Test(trend='no trend', h=False, p=0.9535148145990886, z=0.05829353811789905, Tau=0.002073661405137728, s=134.0, var_s=5205500.0, slope=8.408683160625719e-06)
```
Whereas, the output is a named tuple, so you can call by name for specific result:
```python
print(result.slope)
```
or, you can directly unpack your results like this:
```python
trend, h, p, z, Tau, s, var_s, slope = mk.original_test(data)
```
