# Azure Cosmos client library for Python

Welcome to the repo containing all things Python for the Azure Cosmos DB API which is published with name [azure-cosmos](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-cosmos/). For documentation please see the Microsoft Azure [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sdk-python).

# Getting started

## Pre-requirements

Python 2.7, Python 3.3, Python 3.4, or Python 3.5
https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you use Microsoft Visual Studio as IDE (we use 2015), please install the
following extension for Python.
http://microsoft.github.io/PTVS/

Install Cosmos DB emulator
Follow instruction at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator 

## Installation

    $ python setup.py install

    or

    $ pip install azure-cosmos

## Running Testing

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-python.git
cd azure-cosmos-python
```

Most of the test files under test sub-folder require you to enter your Azure Cosmos master key and host endpoint: 

    masterKey = '[YOUR_KEY_HERE]'
    host = '[YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE]'

To run the tests:

    $ python -m unittest discover -s .\test -p "*.py" 

    If you use Microsoft Visual Studio, open the project file python.pyproj,
    and run all the tests in Test Explorer.

**Note:**  
Most of the test cases create containers in your Cosmos account. Containers are billing entities. By running these test cases, you may incur monetary costs on your account.

## Documentation generation

    Install Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html

    $ cd doc
    $ sphinx-apidoc -f -e -o api ..\azure\cosmos
    $ make.bat html

- Added support for collection quota headers
- Bugfix for large session tokens issue
- Bugfix for ReadMedia API
- Bugfix in partition key range cache

## Changes in 2.3.2 : ##

- Added support for default retries on connection issues.

## Changes in 2.3.1 : ##

- Updated documentation to reference Azure Cosmos DB instead of Azure DocumentDB.

## Changes in 2.3.0 : ##

- This SDK version requires the latest version of Azure Cosmos DB Emulator available for download from https://aka.ms/cosmosdb-emulator.

## Changes in 2.2.1 : ##

- bugfix for aggregate dict
- bugfix for trimming slashes in the resource link
- tests for unicode encoding

## Changes in 2.2.0 : ##

- Added support for Request Unit per Minute (RU/m) feature.
- Added support for a new consistency level called ConsistentPrefix.

## Changes in 2.1.0 : ##

- Added support for aggregation queries (COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM, and AVG).
- Added an option for disabling SSL verification when running against DocumentDB Emulator.
- Removed the restriction of dependent requests module to be exactly 2.10.0.
- Lowered minimum throughput on partitioned collections from 10,100 RU/s to 2500 RU/s.
- Added support for enabling script logging during stored procedure execution.
- REST API version bumped to '2017-01-19' with this release.

## Changes in 2.0.1 : ##

- Made editorial changes to documentation comments.

## Changes in 2.0.0 : ##

- Added support for Python 3.5.
- Added support for connection pooling using the requests module.
- Added support for session consistency.
- Added support for TOP/ORDERBY queries for partitioned collections.

## Changes in 1.9.0 : ##

- Added retry policy support for throttled requests. (Throttled requests receive a request rate too large exception, error code 429.)
  By default, DocumentDB retries nine times for each request when error code 429 is encountered, honoring the retryAfter time in the response header.
  A fixed retry interval time can now be set as part of the RetryOptions property on the ConnectionPolicy object if you want to ignore the retryAfter time returned by server between the retries.
  DocumentDB now waits for a maximum of 30 seconds for each request that is being throttled (irrespective of retry count) and returns the response with error code 429.
  This time can also be overriden in the RetryOptions property on ConnectionPolicy object.

- DocumentDB now returns x-ms-throttle-retry-count and x-ms-throttle-retry-wait-time-ms as the response headers in every request to denote the throttle retry count
  and the cummulative time the request waited between the retries.

- Removed the RetryPolicy class and the corresponding property (retry_policy) exposed on the document_client class and instead introduced a RetryOptions class
  exposing the RetryOptions property on ConnectionPolicy class that can be used to override some of the default retry options.

## Changes in 1.8.0 : ##

- Test fixes to move the global host and masterKey into the individual test classes.
