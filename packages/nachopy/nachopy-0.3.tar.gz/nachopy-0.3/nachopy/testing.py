Chancho, when you are a man, sometimes you wear stretchy pants in your room. Just for fun.
Do you remember that one time when everyone was shouting my name, and I used my strength to rip my blouse?
Underneath the robe you find a man. Underneath the man you find his nucleus.
Get that corn outta my face!
I looked like a fool last night. What took you so long!?
It sucks to be me right now.
I get to lay in a bed by myself, all of my life. It's fantastic.
Don't you want a little taste of the glory! See what it tastes like!
You are crazy!
[singing] When the fantasy has ended, and all the children are gone. Something good inside of me, helps me to carry on. I ate somes bugs, I ate some grass. I used my hand, to wipe my tears. To kiss your mouth, I'd break my vow. No, no, no, no, no, no, way Jose. Unless you want to then, we break our vows together! Encarnaciòn! Encarnaciòn! Encarnaciòn! [diddle-diddle-dee, diddle-diddle-dee] Encarnaciòn!
I know it is fun to wrestle. A nice pile-drive to the face; or a punch to the face; but you cannot do it because it is in the Bible not to wrestle your neighbor.
Tonight, I will fight the seven strongest men in town, maybe the world. And I will win because our heavenly father will be in the ring with me. And he and I will win 10,000 pesos.
[While taking a dump] Those guys were a couple a woosies eh.
Well to tell you the truth.
My life is good. Really good.
[To a boy who doesn't want to eat his food] Be grateful, Juan Pablo. Today is especially delicious.
[To a security guard, when he grabs Nacho's new shirt, at a party] Eh. Let go my blouse.
I like your cow.
Pssssst Chancho... I need to borrow some sweatssss. Chancho: are you leaving us? Nacho: No, Chancho, I would never leave you. I just need to borrow some sweatssss.
So anyways, let's get down to the nitty gritty
They don't think I know a butt load of crap about the gospel. But I dooo. Okay?
[To some spectators at his first wrestling match] Save me a piece of that corn for later.
Nacho ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!
I need professional help. I need Ramses!. He's the baist. I must learn his hwaaaays.
Anaconda Squeeze!
This man lived a good life. He had a wonderful woman, a lush garden,...and a collection of Russian nesting dolls. May he rest in peace.
Okay. Maybe I am not meant for these duties. Cooking duty. Dead guy... duty. Maybe it's time for me to get a better duty!
I don't want to get paid to lose. I wanna win!
They give me no eagle powers! They give me no nutrients
Hey! Take it easy!
Nipple Twist!
Listen, I know that the wrestlers get all the fancy ladies, the clothes, the free creams and lotions, but my life is good: really good. I get to wake up every morning, 5 am, make some soup! It's the best! I love it. I get to lay in a bed by myself, all of my life. It's fantastic. Look. Go away! Read some books.
Would you like to join me in my quarters this evening... for some toast.
Where are the chips?
My father was a deacon in Mexico, and my mother a Lutheran missionary from Scandinavia. They tried to convert each other, but got married instead.... Then they died.'''

Nacho, I know someone who can help you
Summon your eagle powers!
I think me and my friend are ready to go pro.
How did you get up here so fast?
I don't know why you always have to be judging me, just because I only believe in science.
I hate all the orphans in the whole world!
Not anymore...I like them!
You gave them permission to hurt me like this.
I look hideous.
We saw you from the village... People in the village: Hola Nacho!
Dear Lord, please bless Nacho with nutrients and strength. Amen.
GET OFF ME!'''

    return '''Be grateful, Juan Pablo. Today is especially delicious. Anyways, I was wondering if you would like to join me in my quarters this night for some toast. I like your cow. Holy Father, please receive this man to your kingdom. This man lived a good life. He had a wonderful woman, a lush garden, and a collection of Russian nesting dolls. May he rest in peace. Good toast. So, everyone calls you gero. My mother was a Lutheran missionary from Scandinavia and my father, a deacon from Mexico. They tried to convert each other, but they got married instead. And then they died. So anyways, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Tell me, who is this Encarnacin? You gotta be kidding me. Everything you just said is my favorite thing to do every day. So, you enjoy yourself here at the Brotherhood? But to tell you the truth, the brothers make me cook stew and stuff all day, but they don't give me money for fresh ingredients. And they don't think I know a buttload of crap about the Gospel, but I do. Today, I saw a man in town. People were throwing daisies at him and giving him goodies. Sometimes I would like that kind of respect. Well, to tell you the truth, he was a luchador. Maybe I am not meant for these duties. Cooking duty. Dead guy duty. Maybe it's time for me to get a better duty. I am the gatekeeper of my own destiny, and I will have my glory day in the hot sun. See you. Mucho take it easy. I need your help. Take out the legs! Today, I have the chance of a lifetime, but first I need a man. Your skills plus my skills in the ring, tag team. Aren't you tired of getting dirt kicked in your face? Don't you want a little taste of the glory? See what it tastes like? lf we win, we get 200 pesos! Chancho, I need to borrow some sweats. No, Chancho, I would never leave you. I just need to borrow some sweats. We bet his hair. You can take the Stallion. I'll take the Pony. But you are tall and fast like a gazelle. You can do it. Pray to the Lord for strength. I don't believe in God, I believe in science. You have not been baptized? How you doing?  I'm talking to you. Save me a piece of that corn. Save me a piece of that corn for later. Take it easy. No problem. We are dancing. And then I disappear! Taste it.  I'm going to pull you. Anaconda squeeze. Those guys were a couple of wussies, huh? Come on, baby. But I couldn't have anybody see my face, Steven, come on. Tonight, I felt something deep inside me, I've never felt before. Do you remember that one time when everyone was shouting my name and I used my strength to rip my blouse? What did you think? Chancho. When you are a man sometimes you wear stretchy pants in your room. It's for fun. I'm a little concerned right now about your salvation and stuff. How come you have not been baptized? But tonight, we are going up against Satan's Cavemen. Praise the Lord! But, Sister, they are just nios trying to release their wiggles. Okay, orphans, listen to me. Listen to Ignacio. I know it is fun to wrestle. A nice pile-drive to the face, or a punch to the face, but you cannot do it. Because it is in the Bible not to wrestle your neighbor. No, come on. Don't be crazy. Listen, I know the wrestlers get all the fancy ladies, and the clothes, and the free creams and lotions, but my life is good. Really good. I get to wake up every morning at 5. It's the best. I love it. I get to lay in a bed by myself all of my life. It's fantastic. Go, Go away! Read some books! Have you ever had feelings for a nun? There is this nun. I just wish I could take off this robe so she could see how strong I am. Well, bring her to our next wrestling match. Yeah, right. Then I'll get kicked out of the monastery. I have an idea. Well, Sister, I saw a bum here today. There were two bums, and I said to myself, ''Let's talk to these guys about the Gospel.'' They should be coming by. It was stinky. But these are my recreation clothes. They may have the appearance of riches, but beneath the clothes, we find a man. And beneath a man, we find his nucleus. Listen, I don't like the way those guys just looked at you. Hey! Can't you see this woman's a nun? And if you guys have a problem with that, well, you can just fight me. You messed with the wrong guy this time. You ever seen these moves? Get that corn out of my face! I looked like a fool last night! What took you so long? It's no use. I wanna be a great fighter, but I can't even beat a couple of guys in the street. He's a water gypsy. He know wheres to find eagle eggs. Eagle eggs? I'm not listening to you. You're crazy. Nacho, I'm telling you. This is for reals. His eagle eggs possess magical powers. You could become the greatest fighter who ever lived. In order for you to become empowered by the eagle, you must climb that cliff, find the egg, crack open one of them, and then swallow the yolk. So, what you're saying to me is if I can eat this yolk, my moves will become the best in the whole world. Definitely. High five. Summon your eagle powers. What do you think I am doing? Eagle powers, come to me! Those eggs were a lie, Steven. They gave me no eagle powers! They gave me no nutrients! Sorry. I don't want to get paid to lose. I want to win! I need professional help. I need Ramses. He's the best. We need to get in with him and his buddies. We must learn their ways. Then we must go pro! It's political, obviously. My area, amigo. You see that guy over there? His name is Seor Ramon. He's Ramses' manager and he owns all of the big arenas. He's having a party tomorrow night. We need to go and show him we mean business, that we are ready for the big leagues. Over there in the tree is a chipmunk nest. The best in the city. It's delicious. That is where I get the day-old chips, over in a secret place. And that is a crazy lady. So now you got a little taste of what I do. It's pretty dang exciting, huh? I was wondering if the children could get a signature from you and maybe a picture. They like you. You are the best. This party's gonna be crazy. I mean, we're gonna be pros. Feel it. Go lay down. Where have you been? Like maybe you are a floozy. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Hey, let go my blouse. Give me a boost. I don't think I can lift you. You are too fat. Good luck. Seor Ramon. Who are you? Everybody is a luchador, mi amigo. I think that me and my friend are ready to go pro. So you want to make a name for yourself, horseface? I forgive you. How did you get up here so fast? Secret tunnels. Some say wrestlers make bad lovers. That they save themselves for the ring. I love you. I am singing at the party. I am singing it's my turn to sing at the party. Everyone is dancing Happy party. But Ramses is not dancing He does not dance at the parties. Ramses is number one He knows the secrets of desire. Ramses is the one He puts the people all on fire. Take it easy. It sucks to be me right now! I used to really like Ramses. I wanted to become him. But it turns out he's a real douche. Because I can't go on living a lie. The orphans, they need me, and I have forsaken them. I got no groceries for breakfast because of you! I'm sick of hearing about your stupid orphans. What did you just say? I'm not listening to you. You only believe in science. That's probably why we never win. We never win because you are fat. Buenos das, Sister. So, what you cooking? I've been gone because I had a lot of church-y opportunities lately, outside of the orphanage. To tell you the truth, I went to a wrestling match. lf you fight for something noble, or for someone who needs your help, only then will God bless you in battle. Precious Father, why have you given me this desire to wrestle and then made me such a stinky warrior? Have I focused too much on my boots and all my fame and my stretchy pants? Maybe you want me to fight and give everything I win to the little ones who have nothing so they can have better foods and a better life. Okay, if I win tonight at the Battle Jam, I will know that you bless my mission and that you want me to be a wrestling servant of you. I smell cookies. I am Nacho, the luchador. Tonight, I will fight the seven strongest men in town, maybe the world, and I will win because our Heavenly Father will be in the ring with me. I will buy the orphans a big bus to go on field trips to parks and places like that. Nipple twist! There is no place for me in this world, Chanchito. I don't belong out there and I don't belong in here, so I'm going into the wilderness, probably to die. I hope to see you again, little Chancho. Maybe in the next life. Silencio bruised his bunions. Dear Sister, I know you probably hate my guts by now and already believe that I must have died long ago in the wilderness. But you are wrong, I'm still alive. Tonight I'll be fighting the greatest wrestler who ever lived, the great Ramses. I know you don't like wrestling, but know that I am leaving all my monies to the orphans. And if I die in the ring, know that I always loved you as a brother in God. lf we didn't end up taking our vows of celibacy, we could maybe get married and have a family with some nios. I wrote a song for Encarnacin in my mind. When the fantasy has ended And all the children are gone Something good inside me Helps me to carry on. I ate some bugs I ate some grass I used my hand To wipe my tears. To kiss your mouth I'd break my vow. No, no, no No, no, no way, Jos Unless you want to, Then we'd break our vows together. Vertebrae kick!'''
