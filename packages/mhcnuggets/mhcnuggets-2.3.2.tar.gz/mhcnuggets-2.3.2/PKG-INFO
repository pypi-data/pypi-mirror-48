Description: # MHCnuggets
        
        Welcome to MHCnuggets! Presumably you're here to do some
        peptide-MHC prediction and not because you were [hungry](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/chicken-mcnuggets-4-piece.html).
        
        ### Usage ###
        For an overview of how to use MHCnuggets please refer to the Jupyter notebook
        called `user_guide.ipynb` in the repository

        MHCnuggets is `pip` installable as:
        ```bash
        pip install mhcnuggets
        ```
        
        **Required pacakges:**
        
        * numpy
        * scipy
        * scikit-learn
        * tensorflow
        * keras
        
        You might want to check if the Keras backend is configured to use
        the Tensforflow backend.
