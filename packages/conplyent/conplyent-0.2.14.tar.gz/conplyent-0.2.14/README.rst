conplyent
=========

Python-based distributed console executor. This library includes two main wrappers: console and client/server. Conplyent provides a wrapper around the subprocess library to execute commands on the console seemlessly without interruption on your main process. Conplyent also provides a wrapper around the ZMQ library to create a client/server connection which provides many shell features to control a remote executor. Conplyent is primarily built to simplify access to Systems Under Test.
