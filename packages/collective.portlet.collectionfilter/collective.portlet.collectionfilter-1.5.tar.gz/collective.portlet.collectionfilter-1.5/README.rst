collective.portlet.collectionfilter
===================================

Faceted navigation filter for collection results.

This portlet allows you to filter collections results for additional catalog
metadata.  For example, you can add a subject filter, but also a filter for
authors or portal types. The "Collection Filter" portlet can be used to build
tag clouds.

The filter types can be extended (see:
``collective.portlet.collectionfilter.vocabularies``).

Besides the "Collection Filter" portlet there is also a "Collection Search"
portlet for doing a fulltext search on the collection results.

This package is a fork of ``collective.portlet.collectionbysubject`` by Rok
Garbas.
