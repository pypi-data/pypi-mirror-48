        ## Groupme Bot
        
         A GroupMe bot can be created [here](https://dev.groupme.com/bots) and using the Groupme API can send messages to its assigned group. This particular bot uses a callback URL to be notified of new messages. Once notified the message will be parsed and a response will be created if the `USER_ID` of the sender matches that of the `USER_ID` environment variable.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once a bot is registered with Groupme the following requirements must be specified in the form of environment variables:
        
        * **USER_ID** - The ID of the user that should be mocked in the group chat.
        
          Example: `USER_ID=29384`    
          
        * **BOT_ID** - The assigned bot ID by GroupMe.
        
          Example: `BOT_ID=a6a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a77a7a7`    
        
        * **GROUP_ID** - The ID of the Groupme Chat where the bot resides
        
          Example: `GROUP_ID=0987890987`    
        * **API_TOKEN** - The api token for the authorized Groupme account
        
          Example: `API_TOKEN=983u4ritgo0v98ujkorf`
        
        After the environment variables have been set run the Flask server, `python -m MockBot`
        
        ## Customization/Additions
        
        Feature Additions/Suggestions are welcome, for any particular functionality that may need to be added for a particular use case, simple parse the incoming messages looking for specified input in the `server.py` file and add methods in the bot class to perform the desired function.
