# Singularity Compose

This is a simple orchestration library for Singularity containers, akin to
Docker Compose. See the [specification](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-compose/#/spec/spec-1.0) 
and the [documentation](https://singularityhub.github.io/singularity-compose) for
details, or more examples below.

## Examples

 - [singularity-compose-simple](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/singularity-compose-simple): A single container example (working in full).
 - [singularity-compose-example](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/singularity-compose-example): The same application split into multiple containers. Requires either no Docker install on the host, or install of fixed Singularity (the current release has a bug).
