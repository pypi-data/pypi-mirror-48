# SHARPener


This is a set of tools that have been developed in preparation of the [SHARP survey](
https://www.astron.nl/astronomy-group/apertif/science-projects/sharp-search-hi-absorption-apertif/sharp). 

The main function of `sharpener` is to identify the position of all continuum sources in a continuum image and extract
a spectrum from each line of sight of these sources. 

The spectra are then plotted. 

`sharpener` can be run automatically using a `.yml` [parameter file](https://github.com/Fil8/SHARPener/wiki/Parameter-file) as  `run_sharpener -c <parameter_file.yml>`, or through a `IPython`
[notebook](https://github.com/Fil8/SHARPener/blob/master/tutorials/T2_automated_run.ipynb).

To generate config with `run_sharpener -gd <parameter_file.yml>` and for help `run_sharpener -h`.

The following [tutorials](https://github.com/Fil8/SHARPener/tree/master/tutorials) can guide you through the different capabilities of `sharpener`.

### Installation

**Requisites**
- SHARPener makes use of the most common `python` packages (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`, `astropy`, `astroquery`, `prettytable`) and addition to `mpdaf` and `pypdf2`. 
- The parameter file is in `yaml` format, hence `pyaml`, and `json` packages should be installed.
- Tutorials make use of `tabulate` and `glob` for fancy outputs.

**Insallation instructions**
- Clone this repository. From terminal type:

```
git clone https://github.com/Fil8/SHARPener.git
```

- Then change directory into SHaRPener and install:

```
cd SHARPener && pip install .

```

- This package is also available on **pypi**, allowing:

```
pip install sharpener
```
