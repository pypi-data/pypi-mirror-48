Description: # pyminder
        
        I use Beeminder in a lot of my Python projects, and I find myself writting the same helper functions multiple times. 
        This repository will serve as a place for me to store this functionality and make it accessible to other people.
        
        ## Development
        
        - Set up a virtual environment in PyCharm so you aren't using the global Python env. This will allow you to avoid
        conflicts of dependencies.
        - `pip install twine wheel`
        
        ## Deployment
        
        - Update version number in `setup.py`
        - `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
        - Check that expected files are included: `tar tzf dist/pyminder-{ version }.tar.gz`
        - `twine check dist/*`
        - Test publish: `twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*`
        - Publish: `twine upload dist/*`
