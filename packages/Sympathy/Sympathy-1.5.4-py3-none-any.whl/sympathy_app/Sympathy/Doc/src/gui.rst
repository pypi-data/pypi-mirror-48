The graphical user interface
============================
The graphical user interface or GUI for Sympathy for Data is the main
interface, where you can create, edit, and 	run workflows.

In the main interface of Sympathy for Data a number of smaller windows can be
displayed, where each of these windows have their own functionality. When
Sympathy for Data is started two of these windows will be displayed, the
workspace window and the node library window. These two windows are vital for
the construction of the workflows. The other windows are
more informative.

All windows, except the workspace window, can be turned on/off from the *View*
menu.

A screenshot of the start view in Sympathy for Data is shown below. In
this screenshot the workspace window and the node library window are located to
the right and the left, respectively.

.. _node_library_window:

The node library window
-----------------------
It is through the node library window that you get access to the nodes, the
building blocks of the data analysis workflows. The nodes are stored in a
tree structure and are categorized by their functionalities. The nodes are
added to the flow with drag and drop.

There are two ways of getting more information about a node in the library
window. Brief information, consisting of a short description and a declaration
of the incoming and outgoing data types, is displayed in a tooltip when resting
the cursor over a node in the library view. The more detailed documentation is
accessed by right clicking on the node and selecting "Help". A web browser will
open to display the node documentation. Documentation for all nodes in the
library can also be found :ref:`here <lib_library>`.

It is possible to add new node libraries to the node library window. These are
generally referred to as third-party libraries. When you have downloaded a
third-party library you can add it to Sympathy in the preferences dialog.
Go to the page *Node libraries* and click add. Then add the folder *containing*
the *Library* folder.


.. _`error window`:

Messages window
---------------
The *Messages* window is where all output from nodes ends up; be it errors,
warnings, or simple notices.

When a node has something to say it will add a single row to the Messages
window. This summary line consists of the node's label in the node column and a
summary of the output in the details column. If you click on the arrowhead to
the left of the node label the row will expand and show more details.

You can right-click anywhere in the *Node* column and choose *Clear* to remove
any old content from this view and more easily notice new output.

There are four different severities in the output, ranging from least to most
severe:

Notice
  Informative non-crucial output that does not affect the node's ability to
  complete its task. For messages at this level the node label is green and
  accompanied by a tick mark.

Warnings
  A node will give you a warning when it suspects that something might be
  wrong, but it is still able to complete its task. You should usually take a
  look at any warnings and judge for yourself if some action needs to be taken.
  For messages at this level the node label is yellow and accompanied by a
  yellow warning sign.

Error
  An unrecoverable error occurred during node execution. These errors are
  usually due to problems with either the node's configuration or the data that
  it received. The details can sometimes give more information about how to fix
  the problem. For error messages the node label is red and accompanied by a
  red warning sign.

Exception
  Like the *Error* level this also represents some unrecoverable error during
  node execution. The difference is that an exception is some kind of error
  that the node developer has not anticipated. Sometimes these errors can be
  fixed simply by fixing some problem with the configuration or input data, but
  it can also be that there is some problem that needs to be fixed in the
  source code for the node.

  A good quality node should in principle never give exceptions. You should
  consider reporting any exceptions you see to the node developer. The details
  for an exception will provide a stack trace which gives information to the
  node developer about where in the code the error arose. Messages at this level
  look just like error messages except for the traceback provided in the
  details.


.. _`flow_overview`:

Flow overview
-------------
The flow overview can be accessed via the view menu. It shows all subflows and
nodes in the current workflow. Click on a node or subflow to jump to that node
or subflow.

When typing something into the filter textbox only subflows and nodes whose
labels match the filter are shown. This can help you quickly find nodes or
subflows even in very large workflows.


Undo stack
----------
The undo stack shows all historical operations preformed in the active
workflow. Each operation (create node, move node, delete node, connect nodes
etc.) is represented by a row in the undo stack with new operations being added
at the bottom. If you select a specific row Sympathy will undo all operations
below the selected row, effectively jumping to a point in time just after the
selected operation was performed.


.. _`data_viewer`:

Data viewer
-----------

The data viewer shipped with Sympathy for Data allows easy and fast inspection
of the data stored in the different data types. It can be either called
directly from within Sympathy for Data by double clicking an output port of any
executed :ref:`node <node_section>` or by launching it from the command line as
described in the :ref:`launch options <launch_options>`.

Preview Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The appearance of the Data viewer varies depending on the loaded data type. In the
tables view a list of available tables is shown on the very left. Selecting different
items of the list will bring the selected table data into the table preview. The
preview table has a toolbar with some useful functions:

- The search box allows a quick search of the column names. For further
  explanation of the functionality, see :ref:`below <search_bar>`.
- The button with some lines and an arrow is for jumping to a specific row.
  When data is transposed this will scroll the view horizontally instead of
  vertically.
- The document icon toggles between a view of the table's data and its attributes.
  In case there are no attributes, this view will be empty.
- The transpose button flips the table so that rows become columns and columns
  become rows. This can be useful, for example, when there are many columns with long
  names, but fewer rows.
- The three color circle icon toggles the data type background coloring in the
  data table view on/off.
- The graph icon toggles the :ref:`plot view <plot_view>` on/off.

.. figure:: screenshot_viewer_preview_toolbar.png
   :alt: Data viewer preview table toolbar.

   Screenshot of the preview table toolbar showing the searchbar and toggle buttons.

The preview table also has a right-click context menu allowing quick selection
of columns to plot as either *x* (Plot as x) or *y* (Plot as y) signal. Multiple columns
can be plotted against the same x signal. *Show histogram* will show a histogram
together with some basic statistics of the selected column.

The number of rows and columns (row x column) is shown in a little box on the bottom
left of the preview table.

.. note:: Due to limitations of the underlying GUI framework, tables with more then
   71'582'788 rows will be truncated. This will be shown with a line in red:
   **Data truncated**. This does not influence the plotting capability of large data.


.. _`search_bar`:

Searchbar
+++++++++

The searchbar allows you to filter what columns are shown in the preview table.
The default filtering is performed on the column names only by means of a
*fuzzy* filter, as shown in the example where the column names are TEST, CAR,
PLANE and TURBINE.

+----+----------------------+
| A  | CAR, PLANE           |
+----+----------------------+
| E  | TEST, PLANE, TURBINE |
+----+----------------------+
| NE | PLANE, TURBINE       |
+----+----------------------+

If you enter a ``*`` or ``?`` wildcards, the filtering changes to a *glob*
filter, where ``*`` matches any number of any character and ``?`` matches
exactly one. Please be aware that the *glob* filter shows only exact
matches for the search pattern. Some examples.

+--------+----------------+
| T*     | TEST, TURBINE  |
+--------+----------------+
| \\*NE  | PLANE, TURBINE |
+--------+----------------+
| ?A?    | CAR            |
+--------+----------------+
| \\\*A* | CAR, PLANE     |
+--------+----------------+

You can also use different search patterns separated by a ``,``. Each pattern
can be either *fuzzy* or *glob*. Any column matching any of the patterns is
shown. For example:

+-------+--------------------+
| T*,CA | TEST, TURBINE, CAR |
+-------+--------------------+

By default only the column names are used when searching, but there are some
search pattern prefixes that you can use to change this behavior. These
prefixes are ``:c``, ``:a``, and ``:*``. Here are some examples:

+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| :c T*   | will search in the column names only                             |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| :a T*   | will search in the attributes only                               |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| :* T*   | will search in column names and attributes with the same pattern |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

The prefixes can also be combined with the multi-pattern search with ``,``
separator, as well as multiple prefixes are allowed to be chained to refine
the search by column names and attributes.

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| :c T*,CA     |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| :c T* :a m,T | searches for column names with pattern T* ( *glob* filter)   |
|              | and within this set for attributes with m and T              |
|              | ( *fuzzy* filter)                                            |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _`plot_view`:

Plot
^^^^

The plot has two toolbars, one above and one below the plot area. The one above allows
changing of the following parameters:

X
  Specifies the column used for the x axis.

Y
  Specifies the columns plotted as y-values. Multi-selection is allowed.
  Un/checking a column will remove or add it to the plot.

Histogram
  Specifies the column used to plot the histogram. Some statistics regarding the column's
  data is shown in an inset in the histogram.

Plot settings
  Popup menu with configurable settings for.

   Resample
     This integer value specifies the step size used for resampling in
     case the upper limit of 10000 points is exceeded. This value will be
     automatically updated on data refresh.

   Plot large data
     In case of large data columns, >10 million rows, plotting
     will be disabled by default and needs to be activated by this checkbox. This
     checkbox is hidden for datasets not exceeding this limit.

   Binning
     Selecting the number of bins used for the histogram. Hidden in
     *Line* plot mode.

Line graph
  Sets the plot to a scatter plot of the selected x and y columns.

Histogram graph
  Set the plot to a histogram using the last selected/active
  column in the *Y* selector. Selecting the histogram plot will hide the *X* and
  *Y* selection boxes and shows the histogram selection box.

The toolbar below the plot area allows for easy zooming, panning, and moving through
the zoom/pan state history. It also has the option to save the current figure
(Save icon) and alter the appearance of the lines or scatters of the plotted data
(checkbox icon).

.. warning:: Plotting large amounts of rows and several columns can result in
   slow plotting and the GUI might become unresponsive.
