Node writing
============
Sympathy's standard library contains a lot of useful nodes and it is also
possible to add complete third-party libraries without writing any code
yourself. But sometimes you might come to a point when the node that you need
simply has not been written yet. One option is to write your own node.

All Sympathy nodes are written in Python, http://python.org, a powerful
scripting language whose main goal is to be easy to learn. Python has a very
powerful set of standard libraries, but the standard libraries are a bit
lacking when it comes to high performance numerical computations. Because of
this Sympathy comes with some third party libraries that are great for
numerical computations and data analysis:

`numpy`
  The basis for most of the other libraries mentioned here and therefore also the
  most useful library. It provides you with a generic data type for
  numerical data and some basic calculations on those data types. See
  http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial, or
  http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.html, or
  http://wiki.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users for some introduction.

`scipy`
  Provides functions for more advanced analysis such as numerical integration,
  solving differential equations, optimization, and working with sparse
  matrices. See http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/.

`pandas`
  See http://pandas.pydata.org/.

To create and edit nodes you will need some text editor or Python IDE. If you
do not already have a favorite editor/IDE, we recommend *Spyder*. *Spyder* is
suitable for editing Python files and is distributed with Sympathy.


.. _`library_structure`:

Creating new libraries
----------------------
When Sympathy starts it looks for nodes in all folders in
*File->Preferences->Node Libraries* in Sympathy. So to create your own node,
first you have to create a library and add it to Sympathy's list of libraries.

To create a library all you need to do is use the Library Wizard.
Start it by clicking *File->New Library*.

On the first page you will add some meta data about your library. Only name
and identifier are mandatory, but go ahead and add as much as you can!

On the second page you will select the path where the library will be saved,
and a preview of the folders and files created will be displayed.
You can change the common package name if you want, but this is not needed.

When you have finished the wizard, the library has been automatically added to
*File->Preferences->Node Libraries*. Note, this is not synonymous with adding
libraries to the library view.


.. _`node_wizard`:

Creating new nodes
------------------
The easiest way to get started writing your own node is to use the node wizard.
It will create an outline of a node code for you, so you can get right at
implementing the actual functionality of the node. To start the node wizard go
to *File*->*New Node*. If you want to write all the code by hand,
feel free to skip ahead to the section :ref:`node_code`.

On the first page of the wizard you can edit some descriptive meta data for
your new node. Please consider carefully what you write here as this affects
how well a user will be able to understand what your node does. See the section
:ref:`node_meta` for detailed info about the different fields.

The second page allows you to add input ports to your node. Enter a name, a
description and choose a data type, and press *Add*. On the next page you can
add output ports in the same way.

The next page of the wizard is where you choose in which library your node
should be created as well as where in the internal structure of that library
the node should be placed. The *Library Identifier* field should contain an
identifier for the whole library. It should be the same for every node in the
entire library. It should be of the form `<extension>.<organisation>`.
Something along the lines of `com.example`. The *Library Path* field should
be the absolute path to the library where you want the node, and the *Node Path*
should be the relative path inside that library to the folder where the node
should be placed. If your library is present in the file tree structure below
the text fields, you can also simply click on the folder where you want the
node and all fields on this page should be automatically filled. Note, libraries
that you create will not be placed in the library view automatically.

Click *Next* to proceed to the last page of the node wizard where you will be
presented with a preview of the node code. When finishing the wizard this code
will be written to a file that represents your node.

.. warning::
    You can in theory add new nodes to Sympathy's standard library (by moving
    the python files manually) or to some third-party library and have them
    appear in the Library view in Sympathy. This is not recommended though as
    it makes it much more difficult to manage library updates and such. In order
    to place nodes under a certain library in the library view, read the
    subchapter "Library tags" below.


.. _`node_code`:

The node code
-------------
Nodes are loaded from their definition files when Sympathy is started, and only
Python files with names starting with ``node_`` and ending with ``.py`` will
generate nodes. You can place the nodes in subfolders to group related nodes
together. Now, create a file called ``node_helloworld.py`` and open it in your
editor of choice.

Without further ado let us look at the code for a simple example node::

    from __future__ import (print_function, division, unicode_literals,
                            absolute_import)
    from sympathy.api import node as synode
    from sympathy.api.nodeconfig import Port, Ports, Tag, Tags


    class HelloWorld(synode.Node):
        name = 'Hello world!'
        author = 'Bob <bob@example.com>'
        copyright = '(C) 2014, 2017 Example Organization'
        version = '1.0'
        icon = ''
        description = 'An amazing node!'
        nodeid = 'com.example.boblib.helloworld'
        tags = Tags(Tag.Development.Example)

        def execute(self, node_context):
            print('Hello world!')

Copy this code into the file ``node_helloworld.py``, reload the libraries in
Sympathy (*File->Reload Library*) and add the node to a new workflow.

A node is defined as a Python class which inherits from
``sympathy.api.node.Node``. The name of the class is irrelevant. The
class definition starts with a description of the node, then you have to
define some variables that contain meta data about the node. Lastly, you
write the method that actually controls the behavior of the node (such as
``execute``). For all the details of what goes in a node class, please refer to
the :ref:``node_reference``.

You can place several such classes in the same python file, but only do this if
they are clearly related to one another.


.. _`library_tags`:

Library tags
------------
In the example above you may have spotted the tags variable.
Each node can be part of one or several library tags. This specific one:

    tags = Tags(Tag.Development.Example)

will group the node into the *Development->Test* folder in the library hierarchy.

To see what different tags are available have a look in
*Library/Common/sylib/librarytag_sylib.py* or look at the code of any specific
node which uses the tag that you are interested in. If the tags row is commented out
in order to become deactivated, the nodes belonging to that library will be shown
under a library called "Unknown" in the library view.

It is possible to add custom library tags. To do this you need your own node
library. This library should have folder structure like this::

    Common
      some_name
        __init__.py
    Library

Your tag definitions will go into the file Common/some_name/__init__.py (where
some_name was decided when the library was created), and it can look something
like this::

    from sympathy.api.nodeconfig import LibraryTags, TagType, GroupTagType


    def library_tags():
        return [
            ExamplelibLibraryTags
        ]


    class ExamplelibLibraryTags(LibraryTags):
        class_tags = (
            GroupTagType(
                'example',

                # First group
                [GroupTagType(
                    'GroupOne',
                    [TagType('TagOne',
                             'Tag description'),
                     TagType('TagTwo',
                             'Tag description')]
                ),

                # Second group
                GroupTagType(
                    'GroupTwo',
                    [TagType('TagOne',
                             'Tag description',
                             name='Optional tag name that can hold non-alphabetic characters')]
                ),

                # Third group
                GroupTagType(
                    'GroupThree',
                    [TagType('TagOne',
                             'Tag description'),
                     TagType('TagTwo',
                             'Tag description'),
                     TagType('TagThree',
                             'Tag description')],
                    name='Optional group name that can hold non-alphabetic characters')
                ]
            )
        )

        def __init__(self):
            super(ExamplelibLibraryTags, self).__init__()
            self._root = self.class_tags

This will create a structure like below (if using Separated Tag Layout,
otherwise the tags will be mixed in with those already existing):

.. figure:: screenshot_example_tags.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Custom tags example
   :align: center

Note that tags won't show up in the tree until they are used by at least one
node.

.. _node_ports:

Adding input and output ports
-----------------------------
The possibilities for a node with neither input nor output are quite limited.
To add a single Table output port to your node, add the class variable
``outputs`` as follows::

    from __future__ import (print_function, division, unicode_literals,
                            absolute_import)
    import numpy as np

    from sympathy.api import node as synode
    from sympathy.api.nodeconfig import Ports, Port, Tags, Tag

    class FooTableNode(synode.Node):
        """Creates a foo Table"""

        name = 'Create foo Table'
        nodeid = 'com.example.boblib.footable'
        author = 'Bob <bob@example.com>'
        copyright = '(C) 2014, 2017 Example Organization'
        version = '1.0'
        tags = Tags(Tag.Development.Example)

        outputs = Ports([Port.Table('Table of foo', name='foo')])

        def execute(self, node_context):
            outputfile = node_context.output['foo']
            outputfile.set_column_from_array('foo column', np.array([1, 2, 3]))

Also notice the new `import` statements at the head of the file. Reload the
library and add a new instance of your node to a workflow. You can see that it
now has an output port of the Table type.

Writing to the output file is as easy as adding those two lines to your
``execute`` method.

The object ``outputfile`` which is used in the example is of the class
:class:`table.File` Please refer to the :ref:`tableapi` to get more information
about how to interact with the Table data type. Once again, reload the
libraries, add the node to a flow, and execute it. With these changes the node
will produce an output table with a single column called *foo column*
containing the values 1, 2, and 3.

Inspect the output by double clicking on the output port of your node. It will
open in Sympathy's internal data viewer.

If you want your output to be a modified version of the input you can use the
``source`` method::

    from __future__ import (print_function, division, unicode_literals,
                            absolute_import)
    import numpy as np

    from sympathy.api import node as synode
    from sympathy.api.nodeconfig import Ports, Port, Tags, Tag

    class AddBarNode(synode.Node):
        """Adds a bar column to a Table."""

        name = 'Add bar column'
        nodeid = 'com.example.boblib.addbar'
        author = 'Bob <bob@example.com>'
        copyright = '(C) 2014, 2017 Example Organization'
        version = '1.0'
        tags = Tags(Tag.Development.Example)

        inputs = Ports([Port.Table('Input Table', name='foo')])
        outputs = Ports([Port.Table('Table with some added bar', name='foobar')])

        def execute(self, node_context):
            inputfile = node_context.input['foo']
            outputfile = node_context.output['foobar']
            outputfile.source(inputfile)
            number_of_rows = inputfile.number_of_rows()
            outputfile.set_column_from_array('bar',
                np.arange(number_of_rows, dtype=int))

All the other basic port data types are also available in the ``Port`` class,
such as ``ADAF``, ``Datasource``, and ``Text``. Try changing your port to some
other type and add it again to a flow (do not forget to reload libraries first)
to see the port data type change. You can also just as easily add several input
or output ports to a node::

    inputs = Ports([Port.Datasource('Input foo file', name='foofile'),
                    Port.ADAFs('All the data', name='alldata')])
    outputs = Ports([Port.Table('Table with baz', name='baz'),
                     Port.ADAF('The best data', name='outdata')])

Note though that the different data types have different APIs whose references
can be found here: :ref:`datatypeapis`.

If you need ports of some type which does not have its own method in
:class:`Port` (such as generic types or lambdas) see :ref:`custom_ports`.


.. _node_parameters:

Adding a configuration GUI
--------------------------
Many of the nodes in the standard library have some configuration settings that
affect the details of what the node does when executed. For example in
:ref:`Random Table` you can choose how big the generated table should be.

Going back to the original Hello world node, let us now offer the user a choice
of what greeting to print.

.. TODO: Link

Parameters are defined in the class variable ``parameters``. Create a new
parameters object by calling the function ``synode.parameters``. Then add all
the parameters with methods such as ``set_string``. In our example it would
look something like this::

    from __future__ import (print_function, division, unicode_literals,
                            absolute_import)
    from sympathy.api import node as synode
    from sympathy.api.nodeconfig import Tags, Tag


    class HelloWorldNode(synode.Node):
        """Prints a custom greeting to the node output."""

        name = 'Hello world!'
        author = 'Bob <bob@example.com>'
        copyright = '(C) 2014, 2017 Example Organization'
        version = '2.0'
        icon = ''
        description = 'An amazing node!'
        nodeid = 'com.example.boblib.helloworld'
        tags = Tags(Tag.Development.Example)

        parameters = synode.parameters()
        parameters.set_string(
            'greeting',
            value='Hello world!',
            label='Greeting:',
            description='Choose what kind of greeting the node will print.')

        def execute(self, node_context):
            greeting = node_context.parameters['greeting'].value
            print(greeting)

Once again try reloading the library and readding the node to a flow. You will
notice that you can now configure the node. A configuration GUI has been
automatically created from your parameter definition. As you can see the
``label`` argument is shown next to the line edit field and the ``description``
and run the node.
fargument is shown as a tooltip. Try changing the greeting in the configuration

.. figure:: screenshot_hello_parameter.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Parameter gui example
   :align: center

You can add parameters of other types than strings as well by using the methods
``set_boolean``, ``set_integer``, ``set_float``, ``set_list``. Most of them
have the same arguments as ``set_string``, but lists are a bit different. A
simple example of storing a list can be found in :ref:`Error Example` and looks
like this::

    parameters.set_list(
        'severity', label='Severity:',
        description='Choose how severe the error is.',
        plist=['Output', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Exception'], value=[2],
        editor=synode.Util.combo_editor().value())

This list is named "severity" and contains the list specified by the ``plist``
argument. The ``value`` argument specifies which element(s) in the list that
are selected by default. In this case the third item, "Error", (with index 2)
is selected. The ``editor`` argument is used to specify that we want this list
to be shown in a combobox.

See :ref:`parameter_helper_reference` for more details or see
:ref:`All Parameters Example` for more examples of how to use all the different
parameter types and editors.


.. _node_errors:

Errors and warnings
-------------------
Any uncaught exceptions that occur in your code will be shown as *Exceptions*
in the error view. The stack traces in the details can be very valuable while
developing nodes, but are pretty incomprehensible for most users. Because of
this you should always try to eliminate the possibility of such uncaught
exceptions. If an error occurs which the node cannot recover from you should
instead try to raise an instance of one of the classes defined in
``sympathy.api.exceptions``. Here is an example that uses
``SyConfigurationError``::

    from sympathy.api.exceptions import SyConfigurationError
    from sympathy.api import node as synode
    from sympathy.api.nodeconfig import Tags, Tag

    class HelloWorldNode(synode.Node):
        """Prints a custom greeting to the node output."""

        name = 'Hello world!'
        author = 'Bob <bob@example.com>'
        copyright = '(C) 2014, 2017 Example Organization'
        version = '3.0'
        icon = ''
        description = 'An amazing node!'
        nodeid = 'com.example.boblib.helloworld'
        tags = Tags(Tag.Development.Example)

        parameters = synode.parameters()
        parameters.set_string(
            'greeting',
            value='Hello World!',
            label='Greeting:',
            description='Choose what kind of greeting the node will print.')

        def execute(self, node_context):
            greeting = node_context.parameters['greeting'].value
            if len(greeting) >= 200:
                raise SyConfigurationError('Too long a greeting!')
            print(greeting)

This will produce a more user friendly error message.

If you simply want to warn the user of something that *might* be a concern but
which does not stop the node from performing its task, use the function
``sympathy.api.exceptions.sywarn``::

    from sympathy.api.exceptions import sywarn
    from sympathy.api import node as synode
    from sympathy.api.nodeconfig import Tags, Tag

    class HelloWorldNode(synode.Node):
        """Prints a custom greeting to the node output."""

        name = 'Hello world!'
        author = 'Bob <bob@example.com>'
        copyright = '(C) 2014, 2017 Example Organization'
        version = '4.0'
        icon = ''
        description = 'An amazing node!'
        nodeid = 'com.example.boblib.helloworld'
        tags = Tags(Tag.Development.Example)

        parameters = synode.parameters()
        parameters.set_string(
            'greeting',
            value='Hello world!',
            label='Greeting:',
            description='Choose what kind of greeting the node will print.')

        def execute(self, node_context):
            greeting = node_context.parameters['greeting'].value
            if len(greeting) >= 100:
                sywarn("That's a very long greeting. Perhaps too wordy?")
            print(greeting)

See :ref:`error window` for more info about how the error view shows different
types of output. See the :ref:`Error Example` node for another example.

Documenting nodes
-----------------

Sympathy uses `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_ for
producing html documentation for nodes and the platform.

Documentation is generated for the platform together with all libraries that are
in use. The automatic node documentation uses docstrings from node classes and
their python modules as well as description fields (top-level node description,
node port descriptions and descriptions of node parameters). For this to work
well, it requires docstrings some of these fields to be written in Sphinx
compliant reStructuredText format. Additionally, documentation for other
functions and classes can benefit from using numpy format, see `A Guide to
NumPy/SciPy Documentation
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/docs/howto_document.html>`_.

The documentation can be built from inside the Sympathy GUI (*Help->Generate
documentation*) or from the command-line, see :ref:`start_options`.

.. _example_flows:

Example flows
-------------

Workflows in the Examples directory (create it, if it does not exist, before
adding example flows) of a library will be treated as examples.

Example flows are treated similarly to test workflows in that they are executed
automatically when running the built-in test suite. See :ref:`lib_tests`.

Additionally, example flows can specify (on the top-level) that they are
examples for one or several nodes by including a reference in the following
format: :code:`Node example: *<node-identifier>*` (for example, :code:`Node
example: *com.example.boblib.helloworld*`) inside text fields.  Alternatively,
to make the example reference fit better as part of a sentence, the following
format is also supported: :code:`Node example for *<node-identifier>*`.

The documentation for referenced nodes will include links to referencing
example flows. Example flows are copied into the documentation folder and as a
rule, it is best if they are self-contained and do not depend on other
workflows or data files.
