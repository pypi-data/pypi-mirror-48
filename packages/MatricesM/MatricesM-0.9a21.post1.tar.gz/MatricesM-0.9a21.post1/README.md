                     ranged=[*args] | dict;"""
                              ->To apply all the elements give a list | tuple
                              ->To apply every column individually give a dictionary as {"Column_name":[*args], ...}

                                   2)If 'fill' is gauss or lognormvariate mean and standard deviation are picked from this attribute as [mean,standard_deviation];
                                   3)If 'fill' is triangular, range of the numbers and the mode as [minimum,maximum,mode];
                                   4)If 'fill' is gammavariate or betavariate, alpha and beta values are picked as [alpha,beta]
                                   5)If 'fill' is expovariate, lambda value have to be given in a list as [lambda]"""                   

                     header=hasHeader, #Optional, boolean. Default is 0. Wheter or not the dataset in the "directory" has a header row

                     features=columnNames #Optional, list of strings. If no argument given, columns get named "Col {}".format(colNumber) 
                     
                     seed=randomSeed #Optional, int. Seed to generate the random numbers from, doesn't affect anything if numbers are provided.
                       
                     dtype=dataType #Optional, int|float|complex|dataframe. Data type the matrix will hold, default is float.
                     
                     coldtypes=listOfTypes #Requires dtype==dataframe to work. Contains the data types each column will hold. If nothing is passed, types get declared by the first row.
                     
                     implicit=False #Optional, boolean. If necessary parameters are given, this can be set to True to speed up the setup process. Don't change if you aren't sure what your matrix requires to work properly.
                     )
"""
Using *args = Pass arguments matching with the parameters in order : dim, listed, directory, fill, ranged, seed, header, features, decimal, dtype, coldtypes, implicit
Using **kwargs = Make sure to use given parameter names OR give a dictionary with keys being parameter names as strings, values being their values

 Example:
         Matrix(3,"1 3 5 2 4 6 3 5 7",dtype=int)                             --> Use both *args and **kwargs
         Matrix(directory='.../directory/file.csv',header=1,dtype=dataframe) --> Use **kwargs
         Matrix(kwargs={'dim':4,'fill':triangular,'ranged'=(0,10,6)})        --> Use **kwargs with a dictionary
         Matrix(kwargs=anotherMatrix.kwargs)                                 --> Same as anotherMatrix.copy OR eval(anotherMatrix.obj)

                     seed=21751923)
```
----------------------------------------
##### Create special matrices
```python 
from MatricesM.constructors.matrices import Identity

#3x3 identity matrix
id3 = Matrix(listed=Identity(3))

from MatricesM.constructors.matrices import Symmetrical

#A 8x8 symmetrical matrix filled with numbers in range from 0 to 1 with uniform distribution 
sym1 = Matrix(listed=Symmetrical(8))

``` 
----------------------------------------
##### Give list of numbers to create matrices
```python 
#Creates a matrix with the given list of numbers
filled_rows = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

C = Matrix(listed=filled_rows) 

#Create a dataframe from a list
data = [["James",180.4,85],
        ["Tom",172,73],
        ["Sophia",168.25,65]]
        
df = Matrix(listed=data,
            dtype=dataframe,
            features=["Name","Height","Weight"],
            decimal=1)

#coldtypes parameter may be required in cases where the data given doesn't represent the desired data types
``` 
----------------------------------------
##### Give a string filled with data and use the numbers in it to create a matrix
```python 
#Creates a 3x3 matrix from the given string
C1 = Matrix(3,"1 0 -1 4 5 5 1 2 2") 

#Creates a 2x4 matrix from the given string
C2 = Matrix([2,4],"5 -2 -3 2 1 0 0 4")

#Create a matrix from the given string, dimension is *required* as [dataAmount,features]. Only numbers are picked up
data="""1,K,60,69900,6325
2,K,30,79000,5200
3,E,52,85500,7825
4,E,57,17100,8375
5,E,55,5500,5450
6,E,68,27200,8550
7,E,41,20500,4500
8,E,20,69000,5050
9,K,33,13200,8325
10,E,37,31800,5975"""

#As an integer matrix
intMat = Matrix(dim=[10,4],
                listed=data,
                features=["id","age","num1","num2"],
                dtype=int) 

#Or as a dataframe
df = Matrix(dim=[10,4],
            listed=data,
            features=["id","age","num1","num2"],
            dtype=dataframe,
            coldtypes=[int]*4)

```
----------------------------------------
##### Read data from csv files 
###### If there is a header, set header to any boolean value == True . Float numbers considered to be using dot(.) to separate decimal places and cammas(,) are used to separate columns. Will be updated in the future for more options
```python 
data_directory = r"Example\Directory\DATAFILE"

data_matrix = Matrix(directory=data_directory,header=1,dtype=dataframe,coldtypes=[str,float,...]) #Create a dataframe matrix from a csv file

#If you're having issues with setting the dimension, try explicitly providing it as dim=[data_amount,feature_amount]
#More options for reading the file will be added in the future

#Example dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009
winedata = Matrix(directory="...\Data\winequality-red.csv",header=1,dtype=dataframe,coldtypes=[float]*12)
```
----------------------------------------
##### Get specific parts of the matrix
```python
#All rows' second to forth columns as a matrix
Matrix[:,1:4] == Matrix.t[1:4,:].t

#Nineth column of every even numbered row as a matrix
Matrix[::2,8] == Matrix[::2,8:9] == Matrix.col(9)[::2] == Matrix["Col 9"][::2] == Matrix.select(("Col 9"))[::2]

#Forth to seventh rows as a matrix
Matrix[3:7] 

#Fifth row's eighth element (returns the value as it is, not a new matrix)
Matrix[4,7] == Matrix.matrix[4][7]

#Use column names
Matrix["Col 3","Col 1","Col 2"] == Matrix.select(("Col 3","Col 1","Col 2"))
```
----------------------------------------
##### Filter out depending on what you need
```python 
#Using example dataset, get the rows where the "quality" feature is higher or equal to 6 and pH in range (3,3.3)
#All statements should be properly closed with parentheses
wineOverSix = winedata.where("(quality>6) and ((pH<3.3) and (pH>3))")
#Alternative way (2x faster)
wineOverSix = winedata[(winedata["quality"]>6) & ((winedata["pH"]<3.3) & (winedata["pH"]>3))]

#Select the columns of pH and quality and assign them to another matrix
filtered = winedata.select(("pH","quality"))
#Alternative way (2x faster)
filtered = winedata["pH","quality"] 


#Set index column to reverse further actions
winedata.indexSet()

#Sort by given column and shuffle the data
winedata.sortBy("quality") #Data is sorted in increasing order, use reverse=True for decreasing order

#Shuffle the rows
winedata.shuffle()

#Get 20 samples from the data under desired conditions
winedata.sample(20,"(quality>5) and ((alcohol<11) or (density>0.95))")
#Alternative way (1.5x faster)
winedata[(winedata["quality"]>5) & ((winedata["alcohol"]<11) | (winedata["density"]>0.95))].sample(20)

#Return all the rows and select 'alcohol' and 'quality' columns where quality is higher than 6
winedata[winedata["quality"]>6,("alcohol", "quality")]

```
----------------------------------------
##### Apply arithmetic operations to individual rows and columns.
```python
#Create a 1000x2 dataframe filled using normal distribution with given arguments
marketData = Matrix((1000,2),fill=gauss,ranged={"Price":(250,60),"Discount":(8,2)},dtype=dataframe)

#Change invalid values in "Discount" column where it's less than 0 to 0
marketData[marketData["Discount"]<0,"Discount"] = 0

#Explore the data
marketData.describe

#Multiply 'Price' with 0.9 and subtract 5 also add 10 to 'Discount' under the conditions: Price>100 and Discount<5
marketData.apply( ("*0.9 -5","+10"), ("Price","Discount"), "(Price>100) and (Discount<5)" )
```
----------------------------------------
##### Replace values in the matrix
```python
#Replace all 0's with 1's
data.replace(old=0,new=1)

#Replace all "Pending" values to "Done" in "Order1" and "Order2" columns
data.replace(old="Pending", #(data["Order1"]=="Pending") & (data["Order2"]=="Pending") can also be used
             new="Done",
             column=("Order1","Order2")
             )

#Replace all '' values in the column "Length" with the mean of the "Length" column
data.replace=(old='', #data["Length"]=="" can also be used
              new=data.mean("Length",asDict=False),
              column="Length"
              )

#Replace all "FF" values in "Grade" column with "AA" in the column "Grade" where "Year" is less than 2019
data.replace(old="FF", #data["Grade"]=="FF" can also be used
             new="AA",
             column="Grade",
             condition=data["Year"]<=2019
             )

#Replace all numbers below 0 in with 0's in column named "F5" where "Score1" is less than "Score2"
data.replace(old=data["F5"]<0,
             new=0,
             column="F5",
             condition=data["Score1"]<data["Score2"]
             )
             
#Change value of 'Feature5' to 0 in the rows where the 'Feature1' is lower than 0
data[data["Feature1"]<0,"Feature5"] = 0

#Create a matrix with a square filled with 0's in the middle, 5's outside
s = Matrix(10,fill=5,dtype=int)
s[3:7,3:7] = 0
#Matrices can also be used to do the same
s[3:7,3:7] = Matrix(4,fill=0)
```
----------------------------------------
##### Concatenate a matrix to your matrix.
```python
#Concatenate a new column named 'discounted' containing the product of the 'Price' and 'Discount' columns
newcol = marketData["Price"] - marketData["Price"]*(marketData["Discount"]/100)
newcol.features = ["discounted"]

##### Printing options
```python
#All the values + column names if it's a dataframe

myMatrix.grid 

#Dimensions + wheter its square or not + the string printed in 'grid' property

myMatrix.p #Same as print(myMatrix)

#Similar to 'grid' but rows and columns are limited by myMatrix.ROW_LIMIT and myMatrix.COL_LIMIT

myMatrix

#Issues about dtypes not matching and/or missing data can be solved by using 'replace' method
```
----------------------------------------
##### Copying the matrix
```python
#Using 'copy' property (Fastest)

newMatrix = oldMatrix.copy

#Using 'kwargs' property, 'copy' uses this one so it's as fast as 'copy' is

newMatrix = Matrix(kwargs=oldMatrix.kwargs)

#Using 'obj' property (Slowest)

newMatrix = eval(oldMatrix.obj)

```

##### All calculations below returns a matrix filled with 1's where the condition is True, otherwise 0
```python 
   A**2 == A*A
   
   A*2 == A+A
   
   A.t.t == A
   
   A.adj.matrix[2][0] == A.minor(1,3)
   
   #bool object can be called to get a boolean value of the matrix, if all elements are 1's then it will return True and False in any other case.
   bool(Matrix(10,fill=1)) == True

   #round call is currently required for the next examples due to <~%1e-5 error rate on some calculations
   
   round(A @ Matrix(listed=Identity(A.dim[0])),4) == round(A, 4) #A assumed to be a square matrix
   
   round(A @ A.inv)== Matrix(listed=Identity(A.dim[0]))
   
   round(A,4) == round(A.sym + A.anti,4)
   
   round(A.inv.inv,4) == round(A, 4)
   
   round(A.lowtri @ A.uptri, 4) == round(A, 4)
   
   round(A.Q @ A.R, 4) == round(A, 4)
   
   
```
