# PATCH has a weird caching story: RFC 5789 section 2 basically says that
# a ``Cache-Control`` on a response to PATCH applies not to that response,
# but to a hypothetical future GET on the same resource.
# I'm leaving this file here to be reminded when I decide to
# check for absence of cache controls on responses to non-cacheable methods.
