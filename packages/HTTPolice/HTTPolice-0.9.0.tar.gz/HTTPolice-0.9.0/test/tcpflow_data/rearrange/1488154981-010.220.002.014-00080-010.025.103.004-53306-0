Date here would suggest that this was sent soon after connection establishment.
But don't be fooled: it had been sitting cached on the frontend for 158 seconds
before being sent to this user agent.

Maybe some cache forgot to add an Age header or something.
But we know it cannot have been sent earlier than the previous one.
