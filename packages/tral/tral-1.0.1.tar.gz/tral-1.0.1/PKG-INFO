Description: Tandem Repeat Annotation Library
        ================================
        
        TRAL is a highly modularized, flexible sequence tandem repeats
        annotation Python2/3 library.
        
        -  Large scale annotation of tandem repeats with *de novo* detectors,
           and sequence profile models
        -  Statistical significance testing, overlap detection, and filtering of
           annotations
        -  Refinement of tandem repeat annotations with circular profile hidden
           Markov models
        -  User-defined output formats
        
        The source code is `documented on GitHub
        IO <http://acg-team.github.io/tral/>`__.

        TRAL is available on `Pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__ and can be
        installed with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ for Python>=3.2:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ pip install tral

        Dependencies
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Some of TRAL's functions depend on external software (`Installation instructions for dependencies <http://acg-team.github.io/tral/install_external.html#install-external>`__). This includes creation of sequence profile hidden Markov models, alignment of tandem repeat units, and *de novo* repeat detection.
