        ==================
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        Add entries to start the Jypyter Notebook and QtConsole from the file
        manager context menu. This offers a convenient way of starting Jupyter
        in a folder. Currently it only supports Microsoft Windows and GNOME (and
        its many derivatives). Contributions to support other OSs/desktop
        environments are highly welcome.
        
        Microsoft Windows

        In addition to starting the QtConsole, the Jupyter Notebook or the Jupyter Lab, 
        and launching the default browser, in Microsoft Windows the process runs from 
        a terminal. Closing the terminal closes the QtConsole or the Jupyter server.
        Single and all users installations are supported, see installation instructions below.
        
        GNOME
        ~~~~~

        When selecting multiple folders, one instance of Jupyter
        QtConsole/notebook/lab opens in each of the selected folders. Selecting a
        file starts Jupyter in the file directory.
        
        Note that in GNOME the processes run in the background. As of Jupyter
        Notebook 4.1 there is no way to shutdown the server from the notebook
        UI. To stop the server one has to manually kill the process.
        Alternatively, `nbmanager <https://github.com/takluyver/nbmanager>`__
        can discover all running servers and shut them down using via an UI.
        
        GNOME >= 2.22 is required.
        
        Installation instructions
        -------------------------
        
        
        Any platform
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install from pypi using pip e.g.:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install start_jupyter_cm
        
        After installation, enable the context menu entries from a terminal as follows:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ jupyter_context-menu_add
        
        To remove the context menu entries execute the following in a terminal:
        
        .. code::
        
            $ jupyter_context-menu_remove
        
        To uninstall the package:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
        
            $ pip uninstall start_jupyter_cm
        
        On Microscoft Windows, the administrator rights are required to add the 
        entry for all users, otherwise the entries will be added only for the 
        current user. In GNOME only for the current user.
        
        Also, be aware that, uninstalling the package does not
        remove the context menu entries. If you are left with the context menu
        entries after uninstalling ``start_jupyter_cm``, reinstall it, remove
        the entries as above and uninstall it again.
        
        Microsoft Windows
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In Microsoft Windows the preferred way to install this package would be
        using the Windows MSI installers if it wasn't for `this Python
        bug <http://bugs.python.org/issue13276>`__. Until this issue is fixed, we will
        not distribute MSI installers.
