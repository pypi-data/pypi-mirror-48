Description: # Chronos
        Utilities for parsing time strings in Python.
        
        ## Building and installation
        
        Before installing chronos you will have to generate some of its
        modules as it is explained in [Chronos readme](../readme.md)
        Then, you can simply run
        
        ```
        pip install bigml-chronos
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        Python 2.7 and Python 3 are currently supported.
        
        The basic third-party dependencies are
        [isoweek](https://pypi.org/project/isoweek/) and
        [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/). These libraries are
        automatically installed during the setup.
        
        ## Running the tests
        The tests will be run using nose, that is installed on setup. You can
        run the test suite simply by issuing
        
        ```shell
        python setup.py nosetests
        ```
        
        ## Basic methods
        There are three main methods in the **chronos** modules that you can
        use:
        
          - With **parse_with_format** you can specify the `format_name` that
            you want to use to parse your date:
        
            ```python
            from chronos import parser
            parser.parse_with_format("week-date", "1969-W29-1")
            ```
        
          - With **parse**, you don't need to specify a `format_name`. Chronos
            will try all the possible formats until it finds the appropiate one:
        
            ```python
            from chronos import parser
            parser.parse("7-14-1969 5:36 PM")
            ```
        
          - You can also find the format_name from a date with **find_format**:
        
            ```python
            from chronos import parser
            parser.find_format("1969-07-14Z")
            ```
        
        You can find all the supported formats, and an example for each one of
        them inside the [test file](./bigml/chronos/tests/test_chronos.py).
