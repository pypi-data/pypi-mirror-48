# Features
* Label's
* Keybindings
* Everything so far is in python

## Reason For Using this module.
* Game
    * Text based games (aka the real reason that lead me to make this module)
    * Tetras
    * Packman
    * Hangman
    * Block Break

* Tools
    * Hacking tools
    * Development tools

Really there is is not reason, I only made this to have something to do and 
build my knowledge in python.  I will though make a few games with it after I get this 
module working. Lots and lots of work ahead still.


## Screen Shot
This is what I have so far, not much but it's a work in progress.

size of terminal when being created so if you resize the terminal the program will not 
know....yet
