Description: # CoopStarter Application data repository
        
        This project is a Python module, compatible with Django REST Framework and DjangoLDP additional module, describing the models and the API needed and available on the future coopstarter application.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Here is the detailed explaination of the preferred installation process.
        Depending on your OS and your python installation, commands could have to be run using either `python` or `python3`.
        
        ### Using sib-manager
        
        This is the easier way to setup the server side of the project but it is known to have some issues, especially on Ubuntu.
        
        ```sh
        pip install sib-manager
        sib startproject coopstarter -m coopstarter_data -m django_countries -m djangoldp_account -m djangoldp_circle -m djangoldp_conversation -m oidc_provider@django-oidc-provider
        sib initproject
        ```
        
        ### Alternate installation procedure using virtualenv
        
        If you get some errors about the `--user` flag and `permission denied` then you should try to setup a virtualenv first.
        Then the full procedure is:
        
        ```
        mkdir coopstarter
        cd coopstarter
        pip install virtualenv
        virtualenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -U sib-manager
        sib startproject coopstarter -m coopstarter_data -m django_countries -m djangoldp_account -m djangoldp_circle -m djangoldp_conversation -m oidc_provider@django-oidc-provider
        cd coopstarter
        sib initproject
        ```
        
        If you get some issues about missing packages at the last step `sib initproject`, then install all thoses packages one by one, such as `pip install Pillow` and so on... Then, run this command again.
        
        For both of these installation procedure, you're ok if you can see the migrations being executed by the `initproject` command.
        
        ## Running the project
        
        From your console, at the root of the coopstarter-server directories containing the manage.py file, please run the following commands:
        
        ```
        cd coopstarter
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        
        ```
        
        This command will ask you for some information (username, email, password) to generate the initial administrator of your data server.
        
        ```
        python manage.py runserver
        
        ```
        
        If successful, this command will make available on `127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` the administrator backend. You will then be able to log-in using the credentials you set at the previous step.
        
        ## Initialising the database
        
        As some fixtures are provided to enrich the application database easily, the following command will allow you to properly load them.
        
        ```
        python manage.py loaddata ../venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/coopstarter_data/fixtures/*.json
        ```
        
        If you have some issues with the previous command, such as `Field table does not exist` or equivalent, please run:
        
        ```
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate
        ```
        
        And run the loaddata command once more.
