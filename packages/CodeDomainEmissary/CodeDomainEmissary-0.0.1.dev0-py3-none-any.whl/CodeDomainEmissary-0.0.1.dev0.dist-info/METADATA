# Code Domain Emissary

This is an NLP project that leverages Cisco's [MindMeld](https://www.mindmeld.com) library to process text into code commands.  

At this point I'm still figuring out what I'm doing, and this is not to be taken too seriously.  Once I actually have working functionality I'll update this readme.
