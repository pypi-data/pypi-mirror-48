Program			:	Remove braces for block statements and place number of statements
Input			:	File path usually java file path
Output			:	A new IR file with no braces but span count & other file 'File.map' with IR index to source code line number
Created			:	20/10/2018
last modified		:	7 June, 2019
Version			:	3.0
			--------
Appendix			:	This file is being modified in response to the newly found irregularity in IR index to
					source code line number mapping. All previous functionalities will remain same other than following:
						1. Each IR in input file contains a string X_Y_Z_W where, X and Z are line numbers, Y and W are columns
Modifications		:	To keep the working code untouched as much as possible, we are writing keyword "_" instead of "invar" for blank blocks.
					Further, this file will be called "File.tk2" and we introduce a method which will read ".tk2" file and will produce ".tk"
					Whenever, there is "$" keyword found in ".tk2" file, it will be replaced with "invar".

Note				:	Unlike earlier, now we are storing IR in an array of Strings, IR. After processing IR array, we write final result to file.
					Later the same IR file is used to read the content, and generate SDG. we can avoid timeconsuming process or generating IR and SDG
					by just avoiding them writing to files and pass the arguments into other modules.

'''
seperateIRandSourceCodeLineNumbers() separates IR statemnts and source code line numbers.
It stores source code line numbers in list called as 'sourceCodeLineNumberList'.
Both informations are separated by a '#'.
Once IR is separated next objective is to remove braces and augment control block range.
If a block does not have any statement within it, braceremover places an 'invar'  stateement in it.
In first phase such 'invar' is placed as a $ sign, after that when creating a mapping of IR index and
corresponding source code line numbers, $ sign is replaced with 'invar' and source line number for
control block and 'invar' is set to the same line number as of the control block.
