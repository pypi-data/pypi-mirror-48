Detail		:	
				This project implements a extract method refactoring algorithm known as 'segmentation'.
				The algorithm uses a graph SDG for analysing the source code and identifying the extract 
				method opportunities. SDG is generated from an Intermediate representaiton of input source 
				code. IR can be generated for any language like C, C++ or Java. SDG is gnerated by module 
				'SDGExtractor'. Further, the SDG is used by the algorithm. and it generates identified 
				extract method opportunities in file ''.
NOTE			:	
				This project is under-development. So, a few features may malfunction or are not supported.
				If bug found it can be reported to author.
