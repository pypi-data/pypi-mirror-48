    "# Simulus Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide describes the basics of how simulus works. All the examples shown in this guide can be found under the `examples/basics` directory in the simulus source-code distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulus is a process-oriented discrete-event simulator written in Python. That's quite a mouthful. Let's first break it down what it means. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.  Discrete-Event Simulation and Process-Oriented World View\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete-event simulator models the world as a sequence of events that happen in discrete time. The simulator basically processes these events in order. Such a simulator would keep a simulation clock, which advances its time by leaps and bounds in accordance with the time of the events being processed along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a professor starts the day with a cup of coffee at 4 AM, reads for 2 hours, has breakfast, takes shower, and then drives to school at 7:30 AM. The discrete-event simulator for the professor's day will go through a sequence of events: \"wake up\" event at 4:00, \"start coffee\" event at 4:05, \"start read\" event at 4:10, \"finish coffee\" event at 4:20, \"finish read\" event at 6:10, breakfast event at 6:30, shower event at 6:50, \"start driving\" event at 7:30, etc. The clock of the simulator in this case will go through a sequence of distinct values: 4:00, 4:05, 4:10, ... You got the gist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete-event simulation is a very powerful modeling method. You can think of the entire world, including the activities of all professors, students, and all people, as a sequence of events that happen over time. The simulator's job is to play out the events in order. By doing so, we get better understanding of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulus is a \"process-oriented\" discrete-event simulator. What it means is that in addition to describing the world as a bunch of events, one can also model it using processes. As an example, suppose the world consists of many professors, students, and people. Previously we described the schedule of one professor. A different person would have a different schedule, i.e., following a different sequence of events. Using process-oriented simulation, every person in this system can be modeled as a separate process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that people interact in this world. For example, if everyone starts driving to school or work in the morning at the same hour, most people would get delayed since congestion would happen on the road. Also, if a student needs to meet with another student at a coffee shop. They would not be able to carry on with their next task (say, to work on their joint project) until both of them can get to the coffee shop. Simulus provides the needed support for creating and managing the processes, making it easier for one to model the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.  How Simulus Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulus works in two ways. One way is through events. You can schedule events and process them. We call it *direct event scheduling*. The other way is through processes. You can create processes and have them run and interact. We call it *process scheduling*. Of course, there's a third way, by combining them and having them both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1  Direct Event Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "In simulus, an event is simply a function to be invoked at a designated time. This can be illustrated using the following hello-world example.\n",

    "In order to use the simulator, we need to first import the `simulus` module and then create a simulator using the `simulator()` method. A simulator maintains an event list where all events will be stored and sorted in their timestamp order. A simulator also keeps the time, which gets advanced while executing the events. One can find out the current time of the simulator by inspecting the `now` variable of the simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, the function `print_message()` is scheduled to run at time 10. We schedule the function using the `sched()` method of the simulator, and passing the name of the function and using the `until` argument to specify the time at which the function should be invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "In discrete-event simulation terminology, the function is also called an *event handler*. An event handler in simulus must take two arguments. The first argument `sim` is the simulator on which the function is scheduled to run. The second argument `params` is a dictionary used for passing all user-defined arguments, which we will describe momentarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the simulation, simply use the `run()` method of the simulator. Without an argument, the `run()` method will process *all* events on the event list and returns when there's no more left.\n",

    "#### 2.1.4  Canceling and Rescheduling Events\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the professor's schedule is rather boring. In real life, we make appointments and we cancel appointments. We also reschedule appointments. Let's make things a bit more interesting for the professor's life. Let's assume that today there's a big traffic jam. So instead of taking only 45 minutes, the professor takes 2 hours 45 minutes to get to school. Obviously the professor will miss the first meeting and get late for the second meeting. So she cancels the first meeting and reschedules the second meeting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do that we need to use the return value from the `sched()` method. It is actually a reference to an event created by the sched() method. Event in simulus is an opaque object. That is, we can use the event reference to cancel or reschedule the event, but we should not directly access the variables and methods within the event class. In this example, we call the simulator's `cancel()` and `resched()` methods and pass the event as the argument. The professor cancels and reschedules the events when she is about to leave home (assuming she predicts that the traffic jam is about to happen).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference of this example from the previous one is that we make professor's waking up a daily repeatable event (with a 24 hour interval). In this case, the professor always gets up at 4 AM every day and carries out the same set of activities. If we `run()` the simulation without an argument, it would never return as there will always be events on the event list. Because of that, in this example, we call `run()` with a simulation end time using the named argument `until`. We run simulation for a duration of 3 days."

    "By default, a simulator starts at time zero. Instead, we can use the `init_time` argument to change the start simulation time when we create the simulator. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simulator can also have an optional name using the `name` argument. If specified, the simulator's name should be unique. In this case, one can use the `get_simulator()` function to retrieve the simulator using the name. If the name is not unique, a simulator created later with the same name may overwrite the earlier one, which will no longer be retrievable using the name. A simulator's name is optional. A simulator can be created without a name. In this case, one cannot use the `get_simulator()` function to retrieve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the previous examples create only one simulator at a time. In fact, one can simultaneously run multiple simulators in simulus, each maintaining its own event list and its own simulation time. If multiple simulators are created, they will all run independently. The event handlers at different simulators are invoked in separate timelines. That is, the current time at one simulator has no relation to the current time of another simulator. This is the default behavior. Simulators can also be time synchronized (using the `sync()` function). We will return to this topic in the advanced tutorial when we discuss the parallel and distributed simulation support of simulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each simulator processes its own events when we call the `run()` method. We can specify either `offset` or `until` (but not both) when we call `run()`, in which case the simulator will process all events with timestamps no larger than the designated time. The `offset` argument specifies a relative time from the current time. The `until` argument specifies the absolute time. When the method returns, the current time of the simulator will be advanced to the designated time. If both `offset` and `until` are ignored, the simulator will run as long as there are events on the event list. Be careful in this case, a simulator may run forever for some models as new events are generated repeatedly when the event handlers are invoked (like in the previous example).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also step through simulation processing one event at a time. This is achieved using the simulator's `step()` method, which processes the next event on the event list and advances the simulation clock to the time of the event. If there is no event available on the event list, the method has no effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the time of the next event, we can use the `peek()` method of the simulator. We can also list all future events of a simulator using the `show_calendar()` method.

    "Processes often need to interact with one another in order to achieve tasks. In the previous homework example, we saw one simplest way to communicate among the processes: the `homework` process waits for the completion of all `student` processes. Simulus provides a rich set of mechanisms to support inter-process communication. We start by discussing the two basic primitive methods designed specifically for the simulation processes to synchronize and communicate with one another. One is called trap and the other is called semaphore.\n",

    "### 3.1  Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "A trap is a one-time signaling mechanism for inter-process communication. A trap has three states. It's \"unset\" when the trap is first created and and nothing has happended to it. It's \"set\" when one or more processes are waiting for the trap to be triggered. It turns to \"sprung\" when the trap has been triggered, after which there will be no more processes waiting for the trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The life of a trap is as follows. A trap starts with the \"unset\" state when it's created. When a process waits for the trap, the trap goes to \"set\", at which state more processes may wait on the trap and the trap remains in the same \"set\" state. When a process triggers the trap and if the trap is in the \"set\" state, *all* processes waiting on the trap will be unblocked to resume execution (it's guaranteed there is at least one waiting process when the trap is in the \"set\" state). The trap will then transition into the \"sprung\" state. When a process triggers the trap which is in the \"unset\" state, the trap will just transition to the \"sprung\" state (since there are no processes currently waiting on the trap). If the trap has \"sprung\", further waiting on trap will be considered as an no-op; that is, the processes trying to wait on a \"sprung\" trap will not be suspended. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1  One-Time Signaling\n",
    "\n",
    "A trap is a simple signaling mechanism. One or more processes can wait on a trap. Another process can trigger the trap to release all the waiting processes at once.  A trap is also for one-time use only. Once sprung, a trap must not be triggered any more, or simulus will raise an exception. That is, if a process wants to send multiple signals to other processes, one would have to multiple traps. \n",

    "The `Barrier` class implements the barrier. One creates a barrier with two arguments: the simulator on which the processes are run and the total number of processes for the barrier. We create a trap for the synchronization and a counter (call `num`) to keep track of the number of processes having reached the barrier. The counter is initialized to zero. Each time a process wants to use the barrier, it calls the `barrier()` method, which increments the counter. If the counter is smaller than the total number of processes, the process needs to wait (using the trap's `wait()` method) since the process is not the last one among the group to reach the barrier. Otherwise, if the counter gets to the total number of processes, the process is indeed the last one to reach the barrier. It calls the trap's `trigger()` method to release all the waiting processes that have earlier arrived at the barrier. Remember that traps are one-time use only. To make the barrier reusable, we create a new trap each time the barrier is reached by all processes. We also reset the counter.\n",

    "Initially, a semaphore can have a nonnegative integer count, which indicates the number of available resources. The processes atomically increment the semaphore count when resources are added or returned to the pool (using the `signal()` method) and atomically decrement the semaphore count when resources are removed (using the `wait()` method). When the semaphore count is zero, it means that there are no available resources. In that case, a process trying to decrement the semaphore (to remove a resource) will be blocked until more resources are added back to the pool. \n",
    "\n",
    "A semaphore is different from a trap. A trap is a one-time signaling mechanism. Multiple processes can wait on a trap. Once a process triggers the trap, *all* waiting processes will be unblocked. A trap cannot be reused: once a trap is sprung, subsequent waits will not block the processes and it cannot be triggered again. In comparison, a semaphore is a multi-use signaling mechanism. Each time a process waits on a semaphore, the semaphore value will be decremented. If the value becomes negative, the process will be blocked. Each time one signals a semaphore, the semaphore value will be incremented. If there are blocked processes, *one* of these processes will be unblocked. Processes can use the same semaphore repeatedly.\n",

    "We use two semaphores: one semaphore `sem_avail` is used to count the number of free slots in the buffer, and the other semaphore `sem_occupy` is used to count the number of produced items stored in the buffer. \n",
    "\n",
    "A producer sleeps for some random time which is exponentially distributed to represent the production of an item, then calls `wait()` on the semaphore `sem_avail` to decrement the available slots in the buffer. The process may be blocked if there is no more free slots available, in which case we wait for a consumer to retrieve an item and thereby creates a free slot. Otherwise, the producer adds the item into the buffer, which is represented by calling `signal()` on the semaphore `sem_occupy`, which increments the number of occupied items in the buffer. The producer then repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consumer calls `wait()` on the semaphore `sem_occupy` to decrement the number of items stored in the buffer. The process may be blocked if there are currently no items in the buffer. In this case, the process will wait until a producer adds an item. Otherwise, the consumer retrieves the item, which is represented by calling `signal()` on teh semaphore `sem_avail`, which increments the number of available slots in the buffer. The consumer then consumes the item, by randomly waiting for some random time, which is normally distributed. The consumer then repeats.\n",

    "In this example, we create two producer and three consumer processes, and use the two semaphores to synchronize the processes to access the bounded buffer. If you're familiar with the performance modeling and simulation, you may realize that we are actually simulating a multi-server queue with limited capacity.\n",
