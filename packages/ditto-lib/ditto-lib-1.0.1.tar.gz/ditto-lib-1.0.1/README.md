# Ditto: A data analysis library

**Ditto** is a data analysis library meant to make processing and accumulating data easier. It provides an easy to use API that is intuitive and allows the user to be more productive. **Ditto** utilizes different **Collections** to store data. These **Collections** are made of **Items**, and each **Item** is represented by various different **Attributes**. These **Collections** can be generated manually, or imported from various sources, such as csv files. An **Item** array that stores values called **Attributes**. Accessing, and modifying **Items** within these **Collections** is very user friendly.
