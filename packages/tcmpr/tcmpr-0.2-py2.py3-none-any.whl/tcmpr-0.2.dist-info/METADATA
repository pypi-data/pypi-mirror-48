tcmpr
=====

Program to text compression and decompression which has
implemented a few of the most popular lossless algorithms.


Description
===========

Program compress and decompress text files, using chosen
algorithm. It can run on files as well as
in recursive way on directory with text files. Solid compression
mode can be set with proper flag, default if directory is given
it runs with non-solid mode and compress each file in that directory
creating new compressed file. Implemented algorithms are:

- Huffmann (`Huffman coding`__)
- LZSS ( `Lempel–Ziv–Storer–Szymanski`__)
- LZW (`Lempel–Ziv–Welch`__)
- Shannon (`Shannon coding`__)

Usage
=====
To install `tcmpr` use following command (assuming that you have `pip` installed):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install tcmpr

Compress file `filename.txt` with default algorithm (huffman coding):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tcmpr filename.txt

Decompress file `filename.txt.huffman` with appropriate algorithm based on extension (here `.huffman`):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tcmpr -d filename.txt.huffman

Other commands are described in official documentation
