VECTOR KIT
============

Vector Kit seeks to make vector arithmetic simple for everyone. It may serve as a utility in a large ecosystem of scientific libraries or, more simply, as a toy to be played with to understand Vector math.
This is a work in progress, and may not yet be ready for large data munging.
