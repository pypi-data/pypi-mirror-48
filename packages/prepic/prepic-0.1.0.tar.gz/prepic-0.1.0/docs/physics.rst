We measure charges in units of :math:`e`, masses in units of :math:`m_e`, lengths in \
units of :math:`l_p = c/\omega_p`, times in units of :math:`t_p = 1 /\omega_p`. Momenta \
will then be measured in :math:`m_e c`, velocities in units of :math:`c`, electric fields \
in units of :math:`m_e c \omega_p / e`, magnetic fields in units of :math:`m_e \omega_p / e`.\
Scalar potential :math:`\Phi` in units of :math:`m_e c^2 / e` and vector potential \
:math:`\vec{A}` in units of :math:`m_e c /e`. We will use SI units throughout.

For :math:`a_0 \geq 4-5` we also get self-injection from pure Helium. Helium has the ionization \
energies 24.59 eV :math:`\text{He}^{+}` and 54.42 :math:`\text{He}^{2+}`, corresponding to laser intensities \
:math:`1.4 \times 10^{15}`, respectively :math:`8.8 \times 10^{15}\, \text{W/cm}^{2}` [Gibb]_ , \
and will therefore be easily ionized by the laser prepulse.

The atomic Coulomb field is on the order of :math:`10^{14}\, \text{W/cm}^{2}` and relativistic effects \
become important for laser intensities above :math:`10^{17}\, \text{W/cm}^{2}` (for :math:`a_0 \geq 1`), while \
QED effects such as radiation reaction only become important for intensities beyond \
:math:`\sim 2 \times 10^{21}\, \text{W/cm}^{2}`.

For LWFA, we roughly have :math:`w_0 \approx c \tau_L` and :math:`\tau_L \approx \omega_p^{-1}`.

If we assume the laser energy before the compressor is 20 J, and 30% is lost in the \
compressor and beam transport, we are left with 14 J in the chamber. If 50% of this energy \
can be focused into the FWHM spot of :math:`21 \mu m`, we get 7 J on target.

Need to resolve the smallest length scale: 20-30 cells/wavelength.

- plasma length scale: skin depth :math:`c/\omega_p`
- laser length scale: laser wavelength :math:`\lambda_L = 0.8\, \mu m`
