        This puts the ``jupyterhub`` Python package and its dependencies as released
        on PyPI into a DEB package, using ``dh-virtualenv``.
        The resulting *omnibus package* is thus easily installed to and removed
        from a machine, but is not a ‘normal’ Debian ``python-*`` package.
        Services are controlled by ``systemd`` units.
        
        See the `GitHub README`_ for more.

        With JupyterHub you can create a multi-user Hub which spawns,
        manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user
        Jupyter notebook server.
        
        Project Jupyter created JupyterHub to support many users.
        The Hub can offer notebook servers to a class of students,
        a corporate data science workgroup, a scientific research
        project, or a high performance computing group.
        
        This is a self-contained Python3 venv wrapped into a Debian package
        (an "omnibus" package, all passengers on board).
