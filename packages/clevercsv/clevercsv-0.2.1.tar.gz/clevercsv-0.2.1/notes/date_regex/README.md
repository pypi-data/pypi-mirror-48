# Date regex

These are some files used to develop the date regular expression. It is based 
on individual regular expressions for each of the date formats generated by 
``datefmt.py``, but merged into a single expression by hand.

Note that this regex checks whether a string is a valid *date format*, not 
whether it's a valid *date* (i.e. 2019-02-31 is considered valid). This is for 
both speed and simplicity.
