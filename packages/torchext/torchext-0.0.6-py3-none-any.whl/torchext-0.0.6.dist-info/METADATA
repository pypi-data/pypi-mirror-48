# PyTorch Extension

This is a PyTorch extension for easy experiments. PyTorch is a wonderful library for deep learning experiments, but there is lack of some necessary functionality such as Experiment or Dataset of Tensorflow. This extension provides some useful Tensorflow like interfaces and makes researchers easily use them.
