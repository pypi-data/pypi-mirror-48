        # fast_package_file
        Package a directory to a file, with fast file access and compression support
        
        ```python
        import fast_package_file
        
        # Package a directory into a file
        fast_package_file.build('a_directory', 'a_package.file')
        
        # Prepare a package file
        data_package = fast_package_file.PackagedDataFile('a_package.file')
        
        # Load a file from the packed directory and save it
        with open('any.file', 'wb') as any_file:
          data_package.load(r'path\to\any.file')
        
        # Or just get the raw binary data
        from PIL import Image
        i = Image.open(io.BytesIO(data_package.load('image.png')))
        ```

        Features
        --------
        
        - Is fast because only the data needed is loaded from the package file, total package size is irrelevant
        - Obfuscates files from (most) users
        - Like a .zip file, but doesn't decompress the entire thing when reading just one file
        - Includes the entire directory and subdirectories, not just surface-level files
        - Files are compressed with Gzip, but only if compression improves file size (per file) and is enabled (per package file)
        - Pretty good error handling when loading package files, just catch fast_package_file.PackageDataError
        - Inspired by video game packaging, such as UE4's .pak or GTA V's .rpf formats
