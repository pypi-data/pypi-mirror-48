Description: # stepTimer
        
        small utility to measure time left after n step of a n equally long tasks, the time withing to tasks and the total time.
        The utility is a bit buggy though... please contribute :)
        
        ```python
        from stepTimer import Timer
        
        timer = timer(nsteps = 1000)
        
        # get the time after 200 steps. this is the total time from the beginning of the task
        timer.elapsed(self, step = 200) #=> 2:30:55 in H:M:S
        
        # function to preaty print time
        timer.printTime(self, <certain ammount of secods>)  #=> 2:30:55 in H:M:S
        
        # total amount of time elapsed since timer was instantiated
        elapsedTot() #=> 2:30:55 in H:M:S
        
        # time left to the compleation of 1000 steps, the total time is calculated as nsteps*average time withing each step.
        left(self, step = 300) #=> 5:30:55 in H:M:S
        ```
