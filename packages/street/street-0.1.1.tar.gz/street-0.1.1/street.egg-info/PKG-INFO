        Scrape earnings history from StreetInsider.com
        
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        $ pip install street
        ```
        
        
        ## Quickstart
        To display the help menu:
        ```
        $ street
        Usage: street [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
        
        Options:
          --help  Show this message and exit.
        
        Commands:
          setup   Set required parameters to bypass bot blocker
          ticker  Get earnings history for ticker symbol
        ```
        
        
        In order to scrape the earnings history of a company from StreetInsider.com, the `street` CLI must look like it's making an HTTP request from a browser. Otherwise, the request will get blocked by the site. So, first visit the site from a browser and grab the `user-agent` and `cookie` parameters from the request header.
        
        To set the `user-agent` and `cookie` parameters for our CLI, use `street setup`, which will prompt you to enter the values. You can find these values, for example, by visiting `https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?q={TICKER_SYMBOL}` in a browser and checking the network tab of the developer tools inspector. Afterwards, the parameters are written to `.street.ini` in your `$HOME` directory. You can also set these values by editing the INI file manually.
        ```
        $ street setup
        User agent:
        Cookie:
        ```
        
        
        The `.street.ini` file looks like this:
        ```ini
        [browser]
        user_agent = YOUR_USER_AGENT
        cookie = YOUR_COOKIE
        ```
        
        
        Now, to get the earnings history of a company such as `AMZN` (case-insensitive), use the following command:
        ```
        $ street ticker amzn
