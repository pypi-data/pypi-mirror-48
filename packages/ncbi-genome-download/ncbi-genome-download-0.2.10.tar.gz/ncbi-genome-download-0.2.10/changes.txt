This is a bugfix release to ncbi-genome-download also adding two convenience
features.

Major changes are:
* Use realtive instead of absolute symlinks for human-readable output (thanks
  @chrisgulvik)
* No longer crash on abnormal organism names (thanks to @andrewsanchez for the
  initial pull request)
* Allow for fuzzy matching of both organism name and accessions
