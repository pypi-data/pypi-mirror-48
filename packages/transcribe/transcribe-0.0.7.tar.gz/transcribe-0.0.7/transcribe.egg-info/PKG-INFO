        Installation
        ------------
        
        Google Cloud setup
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Transcribe uses Google’s cloud services to perform the text extraction,
        that means you have to setup a Google cloud project. Below is roughly
        how I did that…
        
        I went to `The console <https://console.cloud.google.com>`__
        
        Selected *Project* in the top left corner (to the right of *Google Cloud
        Platform*) and then create a new project, wait a bit for it to create
        the project and switch to it (this took like 20 seconds while I was
        trying to figure out what the heck was going on). Then activate the
        vision and speech apis (I think storage is automatically activated) and
        then select Credentials, and create an api key. `More auth info
        here <https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/common/auth>`__.
        
        Turns out I also needed to `create a service json
        file <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#generating-a-private-key>`__.
        To do this I needed to go to `the dashboard for the
        project <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=vision-157908>`__
        and then click **Create credentials** and choose **Service account
        key**.
        
        Then add this to your ``.bash_profile`` or something similar:
        
        ::
        
           export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/keyfile.json"
        
        ffmpeg
        ~~~~~~
        
        If you’re on a Mac and you use Homebrew, you can install ffmpeg like:
        
        ::
        
           $ brew install --with-opus ffmpeg
        
        If you’re not on a Mac or don’t use Homebrew you’re on your own.
