Description: # Jupyter Interactive Cropping Widget
        An interactive widget to rapidly crop images in Jupyter notebooks.
        
        ![gif cropper](static/example_cropper.gif)
        
        This widget can be found on the PyPI repository [here]('').
        
        ## Build Instructions
        ### Install Jupyter and enable ipywidgets
        After cloning this repo, you can build the widget from source and use in a jupyter lab/notebook instance. Before this widget will work properly, you will need to [install and enable jupyter widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html). To enable the widgets for *Jupyter Lab* using pip follow the below commands
        
        ```CLI
        pip install jupyterlab #installs jupyter lab and gives access to jupyter lab CLI
        pip install ipywidgets
        jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
        jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
        ```
        \* Feel free to run this in your default python environment or a separate kernel; If using a separate kernel make sure it has been added to the available kernels via the `ipykernels` package
        
        ### Installing requirements for this widget
        Once Jupyter has been installed and enabled, check that all requirements have been downloaded by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from this directory. Then, open up a jupyter lab instance by running `jupyter lab`, and once inside try the below example using the images in the `sample_image` directory:
        
        ```python
        from interactivecrop.interactivecrop import main as crop
        from interactivecrop.samples import sample_images, sample_names
        
        crop(sample_images,image_name_list = sample_names)
        ```
        For further examples of cropper use, see the `Examples.ipynb`. Make sure to run the `jupyter lab` startup command from the root directory when running `Examples.ipynb`.
