def pytest_csv_register_columns(columns):
    """
    Called on plugin initialization.

    Use it to add your own column types (or override the builtin ones).

    For instance, in conftest.py:
    >>> def pytest_csv_register_columns(columns):
    >>>
    >>>     # constant column
    >>>     columns['my_constant_column'] = 'foobar'
    >>>
    >>>     # simple column
    >>>     columns['my_simple_column'] = lambda item, report: {'my column': report.nodeid}
    >>>
    >>>     # a more complex column type that creates several columns in the CSV
    >>>     def my_multiple_columns(item, report):
    >>>         yield 'my column 1', report.nodeid
    >>>         yield 'my column 2', 42
    >>>     columns['my_multiple_columns'] = my_multiple_columns

    Then run pytest with your new column id:

        $ py.test --csv tests.csv --csv-columns id,status,my_constant_column,my_simple_column,my_multiple_columns

    In certain situations, a (failure) line might need to be emitted for cases
    where the original report was lost. For example, when an xdist test runner
    crashes while running the test. In such cases, the column function will be
    called with item=None and an artificially-generated test failure report;
    if they throw an exception, the their column will be empty.

    :param columns: dictionary of (column id, CSVColumn object)

def pytest_csv_written(csv_path):
    """
    Called whenever a CSV file has been written.

    :param csv_path: CSV file path
