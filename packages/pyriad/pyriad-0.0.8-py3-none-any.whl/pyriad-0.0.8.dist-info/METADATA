# Clustering with natural algorithms
`pyriad` offers clustering with a variety of natural algorithms built with Python on top of the deep learning library [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

You can extend `pyriad` according to your own needs. You can implement custom algorithms by extending simple abstract classes.
Pyriad is highly parallelizable and transferable to GPU.
