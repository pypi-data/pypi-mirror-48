# Clustering with natural algorithms
`pyriad` offers clustering with a variety of natural algorithms built with Python on top of the deep learning library [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

You can extend `pyriad` according to your own needs. You can implement custom algorithms by extending simple abstract classes.
Pyriad is highly parallelizable and transferable to GPU.


## What is included?
As of today, the following algorithms have been implemented:

- [x] Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 
- [x] Cuckoo Search (CS)
- [ ] Wolf Search (WS)
- [ ] Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- [ ] Bat Algorithm (BAT)
- [ ] Artificial Fish Swarm (AFS)
- [ ] Firefly Algorithm (FF)
- [ ] Flower Pollination Algorithm (FP)
- [ ] Bee Colony Optimization (BCO)
