Description: # Python utility for searching country of IP addresses
        
        A python utlitiy package that can be used for getting country name of IP addresses.
        
        This utility contains 2 functions:
        	* update_rir_files : Fetches latest data from regional internet registries
        	* get_country_name : Returns the country name by accepting the ip address as parameter
        
        Please note that the import statement would take some time as it will be preparing the data from all regional registries. This will be optimized in future versions.
