        Arguments:
            props: -
            adminPermissions: Whether to grant full permissions to CloudFormation while deploying this template. Setting this to ``true`` affects the defaults for ``role`` and ``capabilities``, if you don't specify any alternatives. The default role that will be created for you will have full (i.e., ``*``) permissions on all resources, and the deployment will have named IAM capabilities (i.e., able to create all IAM resources). This is a shorthand that you can use if you fully trust the templates that are deployed in this pipeline. If you want more fine-grained permissions, use ``addToRolePolicy`` and ``capabilities`` to control what the CloudFormation deployment is allowed to do.
            capabilities: Acknowledge certain changes made as part of deployment. For stacks that contain certain resources, explicit acknowledgement that AWS CloudFormation might create or update those resources. For example, you must specify ``AnonymousIAM`` or ``NamedIAM`` if your stack template contains AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. For more information see the link below. Default: None, unless ``adminPermissions`` is true
            deploymentRole: IAM role to assume when deploying changes. If not specified, a fresh role is created. The role is created with zero permissions unless ``adminPermissions`` is true, in which case the role will have full permissions. Default: A fresh role with full or no permissions (depending on the value of ``adminPermissions``).
            extraInputs: The list of additional input Artifacts for this Action. This is especially useful when used in conjunction with the ``parameterOverrides`` property. For example, if you have:. parameterOverrides: { 'Param1': action1.outputArtifact.bucketName, 'Param2': action2.outputArtifact.objectKey, } , if the output Artifacts of ``action1`` and ``action2`` were not used to set either the ``templateConfiguration`` or the ``templatePath`` properties, you need to make sure to include them in the ``extraInputs`` - otherwise, you'll get an "unrecognized Artifact" error during your Pipeline's execution.
            parameterOverrides: Additional template parameters. Template parameters specified here take precedence over template parameters found in the artifact specified by the ``templateConfiguration`` property. We recommend that you use the template configuration file to specify most of your parameter values. Use parameter overrides to specify only dynamic parameter values (values that are unknown until you run the pipeline). All parameter names must be present in the stack template. Note: the entire object cannot be more than 1kB. Default: No overrides
            templateConfiguration: Input artifact to use for template parameters values and stack policy. The template configuration file should contain a JSON object that should look like this: ``{ "Parameters": {...}, "Tags": {...}, "StackPolicy": {... }}``. For more information, see `AWS CloudFormation Artifacts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/continuous-delivery-codepipeline-cfn-artifacts.html>`_. Note that if you include sensitive information, such as passwords, restrict access to this file. Default: No template configuration based on input artifacts
            stackName: The name of the stack to apply this action to.
            output: The name of the output artifact to generate. Only applied if ``outputFileName`` is set as well. Default: Automatically generated artifact name.
            outputFileName: A name for the filename in the output artifact to store the AWS CloudFormation call's result. The file will contain the result of the call to AWS CloudFormation (for example the call to UpdateStack or CreateChangeSet). AWS CodePipeline adds the file to the output artifact after performing the specified action. Default: No output artifact generated
            region: The AWS region the given Action resides in. Note that a cross-region Pipeline requires replication buckets to function correctly. You can provide their names with the {@link PipelineProps#crossRegionReplicationBuckets} property. If you don't, the CodePipeline Construct will create new Stacks in your CDK app containing those buckets, that you will need to ``cdk deploy`` before deploying the main, Pipeline-containing Stack. Default: the Action resides in the same region as the Pipeline
            role: The service role that is assumed during execution of action. This role is not mandatory, however more advanced configuration may require specifying it.
            actionName: The physical, human-readable name of the Action. Not that Action names must be unique within a single Stage.
            runOrder: The runOrder property for this Action. RunOrder determines the relative order in which multiple Actions in the same Stage execute. Default: 1
