The files_for_test module
=========================

    >>> from pysyte.testing import files_for_test
    >>> assert 'methods to handle test files' in files_for_test.__doc__


More modules for testing
------------------------

    >>> import os

What's a test script
--------------------

There's a method to show what the module thinks are test files:
    those with certain extensions

Note the order here
    which goes from more edge-case and detailed to more exemplary and short
    >>> files_for_test.possible_test_extensions()
    ['.tests', '.test', '.py', '']

In some scenarios we may not want to include she-bang scripts
    >>> files_for_test.positive_test_extensions()
    ['.tests', '.test', '.py']

Can test if something is a test extension
    >>> assert files_for_test._is_possible_test_extension('.py')
    >>> assert not files_for_test._is_possible_test_extension('.pyc')

Or a file has one
    >>> assert files_for_test._has_possible_test_extension('/path/fred.test')
    >>> assert not files_for_test._has_possible_test_extension('path/fred.txt')

A file without an extension might be a python file
    and so might have tests
    >>> assert files_for_test._has_possible_test_extension('fred')

But is not definitely a python file
    so we cant be positive about it
    >>> assert not files_for_test._has_positive_test_extension('fred')

paths_to_doctests()
-------------------

The method takes arguments of
    1) a list of possible stems
    2) whether to search directories recursively

To test a bit more extensively we'll specify some known stems

First stem to test with is the only file we're sure of:
    the name of the module we are actually testing
    >>> test_file_stem, ext = os.path.splitext(files_for_test.__file__)

And we think there are also some files in same directory called "trying.*"
    >>> test_file_name = os.path.basename(test_file_stem)
    >>> try_stem = test_file_stem.replace(test_file_name, 'trying')

Test with those stems
    >>> stems = [test_file_stem, try_stem]
    >>> paths_to_test_scripts = files_for_test.paths_to_doctests(stems, False)

Only testing the names of those scripts
    >>> test_script_names = [ p.name for p in paths_to_test_scripts]

We expect to find files with the standard test extensions
    >>> assert 'files_for_test.test' in test_script_names
    >>> assert 'trying.py' in test_script_names
