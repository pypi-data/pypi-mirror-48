The try_plugins module
======================

    >>> from pysyte.testing import try_plugins
    >>> assert try_plugins.__doc__ == 'This module holds plugins for try.py'

Plugin methods
--------------

Before the test plugin is called with path to the test
    >>> try_plugins.pre_test('try_plugins.test')
    True

And afterwards we also get number of fails, tests
    >>> try_plugins.post_test('try_plugins.test', 0, 3)
    True
