Description: # Quotly
        
        A quoting bot for 'Discord Hack Week'.
        
        
        ## Install & Usage
        
        Using pip:
        
            pip install quotly
            
        To tell quotly to use your discord-bot token type:
        
            python -m quotly --token='<TOKEN>'
            
        To start quotly type:
        
            python -m quotly --run
            
        Your discord-bot token is stored inside an __.env__ file inside the modules root folder.
        The quotes are stored inside a SQLite database which is also placed in the modules root folder.
        
        ## Commands
        
        Add new quote:
        
            !quotly-add "<quote>" <author>
            
        After adding the quote to database, the command-call is deleted from channel and the user 
        receives a dm with a confirmation that the quote was added.
        
        
        Get random quote:
        
            !quotly-get
            
        Get random quote from specific author:
        
            !quotly-get <author>
                
        
        ## Planned Features
        * Mention discord users in quote
        * Command for getting a specific quote
        * Web-interface
