Description: # tox-direct
        
        [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) plugin to be able to run commands directly without creating a virtual environments first.
        
        This might seem pointless but if tox is used as a single entry point into all developer workflows this can be useful in certain scenarios - e.g.:
         
        * something needs to be done which does not require a virtual environment (because only system commands are run) 
        + something has to run in the same interpreter that is running tox (e.g. testing things inside a docker container where everything is already set up correctly in a dedicated virtual environment)
        
        At the moment there are two ways to run tox envs in direct mode:
        
        1. if the testenv name contains the word "direct"
        2. if the environment variable `TOX_DIRECT` is set
        
        ## installation
        
            pip install tox-direct
        
        ## minimal example
        
        ```ini
        [tox]
        skipdist = True
        ; you could add this to express that it's needed but if it is not installed
        ; tox will create a venv and install it there and run everything from that
        ; venv which somehow defeats the purpose a bit then :)
        ;requires = tox-direct
        
        [testenv:direct-action]
        skip_install = True
        commands = which python
        
        [testenv:something-else]
        skip_install = True
        commands = which python
        ```
        
        If I run these in a virtual environment (`.virtualenvs/tmp`) with `tox` and `tox-direct` installed:
        
        ```text
        $ tox -qre direct-action  
        
        We need direct action! No virtual environment! Ain't Nobody Got Time for That!
        /home/ob/.virtualenvs/tmp/bin/python
        _______________________________ summary _______________________________________
          direct-action: commands succeeded
          congratulations :)
        ```
        
        ```text
        $ TOX_DIRECT=1 tox -qre something-else
        
        We need direct action! No virtual environment! Ain't Nobody Got Time for That!
        /home/ob/.virtualenvs/tmp/bin/python
        _______________________________ summary _______________________________________
          something-else: commands succeeded
          congratulations :)
        ```
        
        So everything would be executed (and also installed) directly in that environment.
