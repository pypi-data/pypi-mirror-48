    A fact is any syntactic construction that can be represented as a tree
    of syntagms, where the leaves are the components of the fact (there can
    be syntagms in the tree that are syntactic markers and do not participate
    in the fact).
    There is a main method that implementations of Fact must provide, which
    is get_paths. A path corresponds to a syntactic element of a fact, i.e.
    to a leaf in the fact tree, and it is formed by the sequence of
    syntagms that lead from the root to the leaf.

    So paths correspond to usages of syntagms within a fact, and are
    hashable, so we can use them as indexes for the syntactic components that
    they correspond to, and at the same time have a modifiable internal
    structure, where we can play with the variables in the rules.

    A fact corresponds uniquely to a set of paths, though there may be sets of
    paths that do not correspond t a fact.
