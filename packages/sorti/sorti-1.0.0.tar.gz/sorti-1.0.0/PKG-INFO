Description: # sorti
        
        An opinionated CLI for [asottile/reorder_python_imports].
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install reorder-python-imports
        ```
        
        ## Why?
        
        This package makes the features of reorder_python_imports fit into my workflow.
        I think the original project is awesome, but the CLI does not work the way I
        would like it to.
        
        My opinions diverge from asottile's on these two issues.
        
        - https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports/issues/45
        - https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports/issues/74 
        
        So, `sorti` will support a much narrower use case than the original project. 
        The command has one flag: `--check`, which will make the command output the
        files it would change and return an exit code of 1 if there are changes to be
        made.
        
        `sorti` uses source file discovery from [python/black] and aims to find the same
        files, given the same inputs.
        
        I don't intend to support anything else than latest stable Python, for the
        moment that is 3.7.
