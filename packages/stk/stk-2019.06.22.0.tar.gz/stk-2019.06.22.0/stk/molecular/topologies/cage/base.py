    Used to represent the vertices of cage polyhedra.

    This class stores information about the vertices which make up a
    cage's structure.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coord : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        The x, y and z coordinates of the vertex, in that order.

    connected : :class:`list` of (:class:`Edge` or :class:`Vertex`)
        The :class:`Edge` or :class:`Vertex` instances which represent
        the edges or vertices connected to this one.

    fgs : :class:`list` of :class:`.FunctionalGroup`
        The functional groups placed on the vertex.

    fg_position_pairs : :class:`list`
        A :class:`list` of the form

        .. code-block:: python

            fg_position_pairs = [(fg1, v1), (fg2, v2)]

        Where ``v1`` and ``v2`` are :class:`Vertex` instances and
        ``fg1`` and ``fg2`` are :class:`.FunctionalGroup` instances.

        Each fg which is paired to a neighboring vertex or
        edge first. Only after this is the fg-fg pairing
        performed. The fg-(edge/vertex) pairing is stored here.

    distances : :class:`list`
        A :class:`list` of the form

        .. code-block:: python

            distances = [(15.2, fg1, fg2), (18.4, fg3, fg4), ...]

        After fgs have been associated with vertices to which
        they join, the idividual fgs are paired up. To do this the
        distance between every fg on the paired vertex and the
        fg which is paired to the vertex is found. This
        information is stored here the first element of each
        :class:`tuple` the distance, and the second and third elements
        represent are :class:`.FunctionalGroup` instances.

    id : :class:`object`, optional
        An id to identify the vertex. Used by
        :meth:`CageTopology.place_mols`.

    custom_position : :class:`bool`
        A flag to inidcate if the position of :attr:`coord` was derived
        from connected vertices or set manually. If the position is
        derived from the vertices then the position of the building
        block being placed is derived from the bonder atoms in the
        connected vertices.

        formed by the edges connected to the vertex. Because the normal
        of the plane of fgs always points in the direction of
        the building block's centroid, this alignment causes the bulk
        of the building block  molecule to point away from the center
        of the cage.

        Secondly, the building block is rotated so that a fg
        is aligned perfectly with an edge. This reduces the rms

class CageTopology(Topology):
    """
    An abstract base class for cage topologies.

    Attributes
    ----------
    A_alignments : :class:`list` of :class:`int`
        The length of this :class:`list` must be equal to the number of
        building blocks in the cage. When cages are built one of the
        fgs of each building block is aligned with an edge
        during placement. The :class:`int` is the id of the aligned
        functional group.

        If ``None`` then the functional group with id of ``0``
        is always aligned.

        For example,

        .. code-block:: python

            A_alignments = [0, 2, 1, 2]

        In this case there must be 4 building blocks in the cage. The
        the first building block has its first (``id = 0``) fg
        aligned. The 2nd building block has the 3rd fg (``id = 2``)
        aligned. The 3rd building block has the 2nd fg (``id = 1``)
        aligned. The 4th building block has the 3rd fg (``id = 2``)
        aligned.

    B_alignments : :class:`list` of :class:`int`
        The length of this :class:`list` should be equal to the number
        of linkers in the cage. The linkers of a cage can have either 2
        functional groups or 3 or more, depending on the topology.

        When the linkers have 2 functional groups, the :class:`list`
        should hold either ``1`` or ``-1``. The value indicates that
        the linker is aligned parallel or antiparallel with the edge
        its placed on. For example, in a tetrahedral topology,

        .. code-block:: python

            B_alignments = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

        It indicates that the first linker is aligned anti parallel and
        the second is aligned in parallel, and so on.

        If the linkers have 3 or more functional groups, the values
        in :attr:`B_alignments` have the same role as
        :attr:`A_alignments`. The only difference is that by default
        the second fg is aligned, rather than the first.

    edge_alignments : :class:`list` of :class:`int`
        The length of the :class:`list` is equal to the number of
        building blocks in the cage. Each element is an :class:`int`
        which holds the id of an edge. For example,

        .. code-block:: python

            edge_alignments = [1, 2, 3, 4]

        then the first building block is aligned with the edge with
        :attr:`Vertex.id_` of ``1``, the second building block is
        aligned with the edge with :attr:`Vertex.id_` ``2`` and so on.
        For this to work, the edges must have their :attr:`Vertex.id_`
        attributes defined.

    bb_positions : :class:`dict`
        A :class:`dict` of the form

        .. code-block:: python

            bb_positions = {
                bb1: [0, 1, 3],
                bb2: [2]
                bb3: [0, 4, 5],
                bb4: [1, 2, 3]
            }

        where ``bb1`` and ``bb2`` are the :class:`.StructUnit3`
        objects used to initialize the cage and ``bb3``, ``bb4`` are
        the :class:`.StructUnit3` objects used to initialize a cage:

        .. code-block:: python

            cage = Cage([bb1, bb2, bb3, bb4],
                        stk.FourPlusSix(bb_positions=bb_positions))

        This means ``bb1`` sits on the vertices ``0``, ``1``,
        and ``3``, ``bb2`` sits on vertex ``2`` of the cage, while
        ``bb3`` sits on the edges ``0``, ``4`` and ``5`` and
        ``bb4`` sits on the edges ``1``, ``2`` and ``3``. The
        vertices and edges can be found in class attributes
        :attr:`~.CageTopology.positions_A` and
        :attr:`~.CageTopology.positions_B` of each cage topology.
        Vertex ``0`` therefore refers to the vertex with index ``0``
        in :attr:`~.CageTopology.positions_A` and so on.

        If ``bb_positions=None`` then building blocks are placed on
        edges and vertices at random.

        It is also possible to specify the building blocks via their
        index, for example:

        .. code-block:: python

            bb_positions = {
                0: [0, 1, 3],
                1: [2]
                2: [0, 4, 5],
                3: [1, 2, 3]
            }

        Here ``bb1`` was replaced by ``0`` because it has an index
        of ``0`` during cage construction, recall:

        .. code-block:: python

            cage = Cage([bb1, bb2, bb3, bb4],
                        stk.FourPlusSix(bb_positions=bb_positions))

        equally ``bb2`` is replaced by ``1`` in ``bb_positions``
        because it has an index of ``1`` and so on.
