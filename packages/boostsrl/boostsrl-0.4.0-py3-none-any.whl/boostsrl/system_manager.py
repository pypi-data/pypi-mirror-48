    """BoostSRL File System

    BoostSRL has an implicit assumption that it has access to a file system. At runtime
    it needs to both read and write with files. This object provides a view into the
    files needed, requests files from the operating system, and (most importantly)
    prepares and cleans up the file system at allocation/de-allocation time.

    Examples
    --------

    This first example may not appear to do much, but behind the scenes it is
    creating directories for each instance of ``FileSystem``, and removing
    them upon ``exit()``.

    >>> from boostsrl.system_manager import FileSystem
    >>> systems = []
    >>> for _ in range(5):
    ...     systems.append(FileSystem())

    Notes
    -----

    Ideally, each instance of a :class:`boostsrl.rdn.RDN` should have its own directory
    where it can operate independently. But this can be problematic and will often
    lead to duplicated data and other problems if multiple models are learned in
    parallel on the same database.

    Another option (which may be more suited to parallel tree learning) would be to
    store data in a single location, but write the log files and models to separate
    locations.
