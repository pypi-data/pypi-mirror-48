        Subtitles with dashes
        ---------------------
        
        You can  put text in *italic* or in **bold**, you can "mark" text as
        code with double backquote ``print()``.
        
        Lists are as simple as in Markdown:
        
        - First item
        - Second item
            - Sub item
        
        or
        
        * First item
        * Second item
            * Sub item
        
        Tables are really easy to write:
        
        =========== ========
        Country     Capital
        =========== ========
        France      Paris
        Japan       Tokyo
        =========== ========
        
        More complex tables can be done easily (merged columns and/or rows)
        but I suggest you to
        read the complete doc for this :)
        
        There are multiple ways to make links:
        
        - By adding an underscore after a word : Github_ and by adding the target
          URL after the text (this way has the advantage to not insert unnecessary
          URLs inside readable text).
        
        - By typing a full comprehensible URL : https://github.com/ (will be automatically converted to a link)
        - By making a more Markdown-like link: `Github <https://github.com/>`_ .
