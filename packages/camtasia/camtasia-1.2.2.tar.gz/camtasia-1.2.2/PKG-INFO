        ========
        
        A Python API for Camtasia projects.
        
        This is intended to be a simple-to-use API for reading information from Camtasia projects. It may grow into something
        more complex, but for now it's likely to include only the things that we need at Sixty North (though, of course, PRs are
        always welcome!)
