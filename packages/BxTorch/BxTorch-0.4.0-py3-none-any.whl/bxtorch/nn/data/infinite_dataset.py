    """
    The infinite dataset works similarly to PyTorch's Dataset. However, instead
    of having a fixed size, it yields infinitely many items via the ``next()``
    method.

    Note:
    -----
    Be aware that this class cannot be pickled easily as generators cannot be
    pickled. It is therefore not possible to pass this dataset to another
    process. If you want to enable that behavior, consider subclassing and
    implementing ``__setstate__`` and ``__getstate__``.

        - generator: generator
            The generator yielding new items.
