Notes about LANL family
==============================

LANL2DZ for U, Np, Pu are unpublished, but their
use is described in ortiz1992a

U is actually described in hay1983a, although it looks like the contraction
coefficients for the gaussian basis set have been modified/recontracted. This
reference also includes Fluorine, which isn't in the BSE.

wadt1987a contains ECPs for Pu, but they don't match what is in the BSE.
