=====================

jul-cc-pV(D+d)Z basis set is a trimmed version of the aug-cc-pV(D+d)Z basis
set of Dunning and coworkers. It is obtained by augmenting the cc-pV(D+d)Z
basis set with only s, p, and d diffuse functions on the heavy (Li and up)
atoms. No diffuse functions are used on H and He atoms.
