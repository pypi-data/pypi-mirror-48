Localrec Scipion plugin
=======================

Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) can yield near-atomic resolution structures of highly ordered macromolecular complexes. Often however some subunits bind in a flexible manner, have different symmetry from the rest of the complex, or are present in sub-stoichiometric amounts, limiting the attainable resolution. We have developed a general method for the localized three-dimensional reconstruction of such subunits earlier (Ilca et al 2015 Nature Commun).

In this project we implement Localized Reconstruction as a plugin (Locarec) for Scipion.

===================
Install this plugin
===================

You will need to use `2.0.0 <https://github.com/I2PC/scipion/releases/tag/v2.0>`_ version of Scipion to run these protocols. Two versions of the plugin are available:

**Stable version**  

Either use the following command

.. code-block::

    scipion installp -p scipion-em-localrec

or

Install the plugin through the plugin manager GUI by launching Scipion and
following **Configuration** >> **Plugins**

**Developer's version** 

1. Download repository: 

.. code-block::

            git clone https://github.com/scipion-em/scipion-em-localrec.git

2. Install:

.. code-block::

           scipion installp -p path_to_scipion-em-localrec --devel

3. Test the plugin:

.. code-block::

           scipion test localrec.tests.test_protocol_localized_reconstruction

=========
Protocols
=========

The following protocols have been implemented so far

* localized subparticles: Calculate the orientations of the subunits of interest and their positions in the original particle images.
* filter subunits: Filter the subunits (sub-particles) based on spatial distance, angular distance, etc.
* localized extraction: Extract computed sub-particles from a SetOfParticles.
* stitch particles: Regenerate a particle (volume) from its sub-particles (sub-volumes).
