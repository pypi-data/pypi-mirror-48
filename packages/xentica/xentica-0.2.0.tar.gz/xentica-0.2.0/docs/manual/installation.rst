Installation Instructions
=========================

**Xentica** is planned to run with several GPU backends in the future,
like *CUDA*, *OpenCL* and *GLSL*. However, right now, only *CUDA* is
supported.

.. warning::
   If your GPU is not CUDA-enabled, this guide is **not** for
   you. The framework will just not run, no matter how hard you try.
   You may check the `list of CUDA-enabled cards`_ if you have any
   doubts.

.. note::
   This page is currently containing instructions only for Debian-like
   systems. If you are on another system, you still can use links to
   pre-requisites in order to install them. If so, please contact us
   by `opening an issue`_ on GitHub. We could help you if you'll meet
   some troubles during installation, and also your experience could
   be used to improve this document.

Core Prerequisites
------------------

In order to run CA models without any visualization, you have to
correctly install the following software.

- `NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit`_
  
  Generally, you can install it just from your distribution's repository::
    
    sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

  Nevertheless, default packages are often out of date, so in case you
  have one of those latest cool GPUs, you may want to upgrade to the
  latest CUDA version from `official NVIDIA source`_. We'll hint you
  with a `good article`_ explaining how to do it. But you are really
  on your own with this stuff.

- `Python 3.5+`_
  
  Your distribution should already have all you need::

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip wheel

- `NumPy`_
  
  Once Python3 is correctly installed, you can install NumPy by::


    pip3 install numpy
- `PyCUDA`_
  
  If CUDA is correctly installed, you again can simply install PyCUDA
  with ``pip``::

    pip3 install pycuda

Other pre-requisites should be transparently installed with the main
Xentica package.

GUI Prerequisites
-----------------

If you are planning to run visual examples with `Moire`_ GUI, you have
to install `Kivy framework`_.

Its pre-requisites could be installed by::

  sudo apt-get install \
    build-essential \
    git \
    ffmpeg \
    libsdl2-dev \
    libsdl2-image-dev \
    libsdl2-mixer-dev \
    libsdl2-ttf-dev \
    libportmidi-dev \
    libswscale-dev \
    libavformat-dev \
    libavcodec-dev \
    zlib1g-dev

Then, to install stable Kivy::

  pip3 install Cython==0.25 Kivy==1.10.0

On the latest Debian distributions you can meet conflicts with
``libsdl-mixer``. Then, try to install the latest developer version,
like::

  pip3 install Cython==0.27.3 git\+https://github.com/kivy/kivy.git

If you have any other troubles with that, please refer to the official
Kivy installation instructions.

Main package
------------

Xentica package could be installed with::

  pip3 install xentica

Note, it does not depend on pre-requisites described above, but you
still need to install them properly, or Xentica will not run.

Run Xentica examples
--------------------

In order to run the Game of Life model built with Xentica::

  pip3 install moire
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a5kin/xentica/master/examples/game_of_life.py
  python3 game_of_life.py

Or, if you are using ``optirun``::

  optirun python3 game_of_life.py
