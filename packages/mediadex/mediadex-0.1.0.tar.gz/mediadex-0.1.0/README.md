# Mediadex

Index media metadata into elasticsearch

## Usage

Give mediadex a path with music or movies:
`mediadex --path /srv/music`

... and watch as an elasticsearch index is quickly built!

You can now query elasticsearch about your media metadata with your
favorite tool such as Kibana or curl.
