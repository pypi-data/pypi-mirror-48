This file describes the steps to install [[doc:readme|IVRE]], run the first scans and add the results to the database with all components (scanner, web server, database server) on the same (Debian or Ubuntu) machine.

Please note that, depending on your distribution, the versions of some software packages might not be recent enough, particularly for MongoDB (version 2.6 minimum) and pymongo (version 2.7.2 minimum; see [[doc:readme|README]] to know which versions can be used with IVRE). If that's the case, you will have to install those programs on you own, referring to their documentation (see [[http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian/|MongoDB on Debian]] or [[http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/|MongoDB on Ubuntu]] and [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/|pymongo]]), instead of ''%%apt-get%%''-ting them.

You might also want to adapt it to your needs, architecture, etc.

**For another way to run IVRE easily (probably more easily), see [[doc:docker|Docker]].**

====== Install ======

<code>
$ sudo apt-get -y install mongodb python-pymongo python-crypto \
>   python-future python-bottle apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi dokuwiki
$ git clone https://github.com/cea-sec/ivre
$ cd ivre
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install

</code>
NB: if you are running Debian stable, the dokuwiki package has been removed (no idea why: it exists in both oldstable and testing). Run the following commands (or similar) if you cannot install dokuwiki, and try again:

<code>
$ echo 'APT::Default-Release "stable";' | \
>   sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99defaultrelease
$ echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian testing main' | \
>   sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
$ sudo apt-get update

</code>
====== Setup ======

<code>
$ sudo -s
# cd /var/www/html ## or depending on your version /var/www
# rm index.html
# ln -s /usr/local/share/ivre/web/static/* .
# cd /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/pages
# ln -s /usr/local/share/ivre/dokuwiki/doc
# cd /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/media
# ln -s /usr/local/share/ivre/dokuwiki/media/logo.png
# ln -s /usr/local/share/ivre/dokuwiki/media/doc
# cd /usr/share/dokuwiki
# patch -p0 < /usr/local/share/ivre/dokuwiki/backlinks.patch
# cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
# for m in rewrite.load wsgi.conf wsgi.load ; do
>   [ -L $m ] || ln -s ../mods-available/$m ; done
# cd ../
# echo 'Alias /cgi "/usr/local/share/ivre/web/wsgi/app.wsgi"' > conf-enabled/ivre.conf
# echo '<Location /cgi>' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
# echo 'SetHandler wsgi-script' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
# echo 'Options +ExecCGI' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
# echo 'Require all granted' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
# echo '</Location>' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
# sed -i 's/^\(\s*\)#Rewrite/\1Rewrite/' /etc/dokuwiki/apache.conf
# echo 'WEB_GET_NOTEPAD_PAGES = "localdokuwiki"' >> /etc/ivre.conf
# service apache2 reload  ## or start
# exit

</code>
Open a web browser and visit [[http://localhost/|http:%%//%%localhost/]]. IVRE Web UI should show up, with no result of course. Click the HELP button to check if everything works.

====== Database init, data download & importation ======

<code>
$ ivre scancli --init
This will remove any scan result in your database. Process ? [y/N] y
$ ivre ipinfo --init
This will remove any passive information in your database. Process ? [y/N] y
$ sudo ivre runscansagentdb --init
This will remove any agent and/or scan in your database and files. Process ? [y/N] y
$ sudo ivre ipdata --download
$ sudo ivre ipdata --import-all

</code>
The two latest steps may take a long time to run, nothing to worry about.

====== Run a first scan ======

Against 1k (routable) IP addresses, with a single nmap process:

<code>
$ sudo ivre runscans --routable --limit 1000

</code>
Go have some coffees and/or beers (remember that according to the traveler's theorem, for any time of the day, there exists a time zone in which it is OK to drink).

When the command has terminated, import the results:

<code>
$ ivre scan2db -c ROUTABLE,ROUTABLE-CAMPAIGN-001 -s MySource -r \
>              scans/ROUTABLE/up

</code>
The ''%%-c%%'' argument adds categories to the scan results. Categories are arbitrary names used to filter results. In this example, the values are ''%%ROUTABLE%%'', meaning the results came out while scanning the entire reachable address space (as opposed to while scanning a specific network, AS or country, for example), and ''%%ROUTABLE-CAMPAIGN-001%%'', which is the name I have chosen to mark this particular scan campaign.

The ''%%-s%%'' argument adds a name for the source of the scan. Here again, it is an arbitrary name you can use to unambiguously specify the network access used to run the scan. This can be used later to highlight result differences depending on where the scans are run from.

Go back to the Web UI and browse your first scan results!

====== Some remarks ======

There is no tool (for now) to automatically import scan results to the database. It is your job to do so, according to your settings.

If you run very large scans (particularly against random hosts on the Internet), do NOT use the default ''%%--output=XML%%'' option. Rather, go for the ''%%--output=XMLFork%%''. This will fork one nmap process per IP to scan, and is (sadly) much more reliable.

Another way to run scans efficiently is to use an [[doc:agent|agent]] and the ''%%ivre runscansagent%%'' command.
