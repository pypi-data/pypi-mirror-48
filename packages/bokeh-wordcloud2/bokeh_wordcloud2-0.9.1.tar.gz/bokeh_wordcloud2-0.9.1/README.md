# bokeh_wordcloud2
a (mostly complete) bokeh implementation of [wordcloud2-js](https://wordcloud2-js.timdream.org)

This extension attempts to make wordcloud available inside the bokeh ecosystem

This was made as part of a learning project to make bokeh widgets, but it was too good not to share.
