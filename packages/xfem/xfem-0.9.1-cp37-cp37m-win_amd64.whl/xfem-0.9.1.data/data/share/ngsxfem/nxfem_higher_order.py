In this example we solve a scalar *unfitted* interface problem with a similar discretization method
to the one used in cutfem.py and nxfem.py. However, we use a higher order method this time.

    implementational aspects:
    -------------------------
    Geometry approximation:
    To approximate the implicitly described geometry we use the piecewise (multi-) linear
    interpolation of the level set function as a basis. For this geometry approximation (arbitrary
    order) accurate numerical integration is provided.  
    To improve this domain approximation (which is only second order accurate) we apply an
    additional mesh transformation as in [1] which improves the geometrically accuracy. Integrals
    are (automatically) transformed to the basis configuration where the numerical integration is
    applied. 

    extensions:
    -----------
    * A Stokes interface problem based on similar techniques and a Taylor-Hood discretization is
    used in stokesxfem.py
    * To be robust w.r.t. high contrasts we could apply a edge-based stabilization. In
    fictdom_ghostpen.py this stabilization is used for a one-domain (higher order) problem.
