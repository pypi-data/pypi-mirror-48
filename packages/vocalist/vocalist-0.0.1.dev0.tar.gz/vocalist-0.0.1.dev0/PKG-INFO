        This is a simple project still in very early development, meant to be used to parse speech into text.  In its current state, it only works on Mac, and only where a compatible version of [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) has been installed.
        
        It was built following the tutorial found here: [https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/](https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/)
        
        ## Setup
        
        Using Homebrew, install PortAudio:
        ```bash
        $ brew install portaudio 
        ```
        
        From there you can install dependencies as you normally would:
        ```bash
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        If you want to call it directly just run the package as is:
        ```bash
        $ python ./main.py
        ``` 
        
        It's not currently deployed for package management.
