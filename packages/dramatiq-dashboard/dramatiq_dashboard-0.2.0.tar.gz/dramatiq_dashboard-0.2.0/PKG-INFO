Description: # dramatiq_dashboard
        
        A dashboard for [dramatiq], specific to its Redis broker (sorry
        RabbitMQ users!).  Very alpha stuff.
        
        It comes in the form of a WSGI middleware, with as few dependencies as
        possible (`dramatiq`, `jinja2` and `redis`) so it's super easy to plug
        into whatever web application you have.

        ## Installation
        
            pip install dramatiq_dashboard
        
        ## Supporting the Project
        
        If you use and love Dramatiq and want to make sure it gets the love
        and attention it deserves then you should consider supporting the
        project.  There are three ways in which you can do this right now:
        
        1. If you're a company that uses Dramatiq in production then you can
           get a [Tidelift] subscription.  Doing so will give you an easy
           route to supporting both Dramatiq and other open source projects
           that you depend on.
        2. If you're an individual or a company that doesn't want to go
           through Tidelift then you can support the project via [Patreon].
        3. If you're a company and neither option works for you and you would
           like to receive an invoice from me directly then email me at
           bogdan@defn.io and let's talk.

        ## Quickstart
        
        ```python
        # Assuming at some point you instantiate your app.
        app = create_wsgi_application()
        
        
        # Import the library, create the middleware and wrap your app with it.
        import dramatiq_dashboard
        
        dashboard_middleware = dramatiq_dashboard.make_wsgi_middleware("/drama")
        app = dashboard_middleware(app)
        ```
        
        Run your app, visit `/drama` and you should see the dashboard.
