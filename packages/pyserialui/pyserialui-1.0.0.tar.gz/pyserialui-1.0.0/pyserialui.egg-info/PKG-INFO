Description: # PySerialUI
        
        Support and examples for Python SerialUI callbacks, overrides and functionality.
        
        ### SerialUI, Device Druid and Builder
        
        SerialUI provides a user-defined set of menus, commands, inputs, tracked states and data views through a serial channel (e.g. USB or bluetooth LE serial), for embedded and Linux devices (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc).
        
        It also includes a programatic API to allow clients, such as [device druid](https://devicedruid.com/), to create and manage the SerialUI menu items while providing any desirable interface such as a GUI.
        
        The [Device Druid Builder](https://devicedruid.com/builder/) is the easiest way to define the SerialUI menu structure and will generate projects that use the SerialUI library and implement your layout.
        
        ### Python
        
        On embedded devices, functionality is implemented by fleshing out the various callbacks in C++.
        
        On Linux hosts, such as [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), Python may be used instead thanks to the built-in CPython support and (optionally) this library.
