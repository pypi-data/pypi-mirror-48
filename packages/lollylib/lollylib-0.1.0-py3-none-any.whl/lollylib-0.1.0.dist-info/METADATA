From local directory:
`py -3 -m pip install . `



#### Linux and MacOS
From web:
`pip3 install lollylib`

From local directory:
`pip3 install . `


#### Running tests
Tests are shipped together with `lollylib`.
If you installed it from web, you may run the tests from Python 3 shell:
```python
import lollylib.test as test 
test.run()
```

#### Installing for development
If you want to contribute to `lollylib` and become a developer, it is convenient to install it locally as a link
so that changes you make will be immediately visible to all `lollylib` users. Download or clone it
from https://github.com/sugurd/lollylib, then run from `lollylib` root directory: `pip3 install -e . `

### <a name="getting-started"></a> Getting started
