/* This source files provides wrappers around the construction and the
 * destruction of your detector-construction class, which should derive from
 * G4VUserDetectorConstruction. You can expand the code as you like, for
 * instance by adding parameters to the class constructor or by calling your
 * detector-construction factories. Just make sure you expose the required
 * createG4Geometry and deleteG4Geometry functions.
 *
 * Once you have modified this file, save it and pass it to g42so as a source
 * file. Make sure you add the --custom-detector-wrapper CLI option, so that
 * g42so does not include its standard wrapper.
