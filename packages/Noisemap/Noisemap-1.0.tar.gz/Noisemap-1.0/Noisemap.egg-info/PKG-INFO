Description: # Noisemap
         A simple library for python which returns a noisemap as a 2D numpy array.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ` pip install noisemap `
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Functions
        
        #### Mapgen
        
        ` Mapgen(size, smoothness) `
        
        ##### Parameters
        
        ###### `size`
        
        `size` defines how many data points are in the array. The noisemaps generated are always square, so a map with `size` 5 would be a 5x5 2D array.
        
        ###### `smoothness`
        
        `smoothness` affects how smoothed out the noisemap is. A `smoothness` of 0 would be a grid of completely random numbers, whereas a higher `smoothness` would have each data point be relatively close in value to its adjacent data points.
        
        ##### Notes
        
        * All datapoints are floating point numbers generated with `random.random()`. This means you can affect the numbers in the noisemap with `random.seed(seed)`.
        * Smoothing can take some time depending on the size of the grid and the amount of smoothing to be done.
