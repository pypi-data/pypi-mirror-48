# Allspeak

*Allspeak* is a pythonic (yet ironically inspired by Rails) internationalization and localization solution for Python web applications.

It's flexible, easy to use and, unlike gettext, independent of any external compilation tool.

This library **does not** use gettext -we find it cumbersome, to say the least-, but instead it works with translations in **YAML** files, compatible by those used with the Rails internationalization system, so you can use any third-party service already compatible with them (for example, [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)).

It is powered by the [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/) and [pytz](http://pythonhosted.org/pytz/) libraries and tested with Python 3.5+

## Run the tests

    $  pip install .
    $  pip install .[testing]

To run the tests in your current Python version do:

    $  make test

To run them in every supported Python version do:

    $  tox

It might be also necessary to run the coverage report to make sure all lines
of code are touch by the tests:

    $  make coverage

Our test suite [runs continuously on Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/jpscaletti/Allspeak) with every update.
