        # Allspeak
        
        *Allspeak* is a pythonic (yet ironically inspired by Rails) internationalization and localization solution for Python web applications.
        
        It's flexible, easy to use and, unlike gettext, independent of any external compilation tool.
         
        This library **does not** use gettext -we find it cumbersome, to say the least-, but instead it works with translations in **YAML** files, compatible by those used with the Rails internationalization system, so you can use any third-party service already compatible with them (for example, [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)).
        
        It is powered by the [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/) and [pytz](http://pythonhosted.org/pytz/) libraries and tested with Python 3.5+

        ## Run the tests
        
            $  pip install .
            $  pip install .[testing]
        
        To run the tests in your current Python version do:
        
            $  make test
        
        To run them in every supported Python version do:
        
            $  tox
        
        It might be also necessary to run the coverage report to make sure all lines
        of code are touch by the tests:
        
            $  make coverage
        
        Our test suite [runs continuously on Travis
        CI](https://travis-ci.org/jpscaletti/Allspeak) with every update.
