![Photinia](logo.png)

Photinia is a package used to build deep learning models.
It is lightweight and designed for scientists who wish to implement models quickly with
high flexibility.

Photinia is not a totally independent deep learning framework.
It can be regarded as some kind of "shortcut" to Tensorflow.
We build this project, since we wish to have an easy, powerful and free toolset to
do research on deep learning.

# Dependencies

* Python 3.6+
* TensorFlow 1.2.0+
* numpy
* scipy
* pymongo
* opencv-python

# Installation

The package can be installed directly from PyPI repository:
```bash
pip3 install photinia
```
Or you can just download the package from Github and copy the photinia/photinia directory
to you project's class path.
