Photinia is a package used to build deep learning models.
It is lightweight and designed for scientists who wish to implement models quickly with
high flexibility.

Photinia is not a totally independent deep learning framework.
It can be regarded as some kind of "shortcut" to Tensorflow.
We build this project, since we wish to have an easy, powerful and free toolset to
do research on deep learning.
