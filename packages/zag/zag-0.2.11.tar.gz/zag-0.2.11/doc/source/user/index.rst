 Using Zag
================

Considerations
==============

Things to consider before (and during) development and integration with
Zag into your project:

* Read over the `paradigm shifts`_ and engage the team in `Slack` (or via
  Github Issues).
* Follow (or at least attempt to follow) some of the established
  `best practices`_ (feel free to add your own suggested best practices).
* Keep in touch with the team (see above); we are all friendly and enjoy
  knowing your use cases and learning how we can help make your lives easier
  by adding or adjusting functionality in this library.
