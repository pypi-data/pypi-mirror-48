        Documentation

        See http://carat.github.io/carat/ for a complete reference manual and introductory tutorials.
        
        
        Demonstration notebooks
        -----------------------
        What does carat do?  Here are some quick demonstrations:
        
        * [Introduction notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/librosa/librosa/blob/master/examples/carat%20demo.ipynb): a brief introduction to some commonly used features.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The latest stable release is available on PyPI, and you can install it by saying
        ```
        pip install carat
        ```
        
        
        To build librosa from source, say `python setup.py build`.
        Then, to install librosa, say `python setup.py install`.
        If all went well, you should be able to execute the demo scripts under `examples/`
        (OS X users should follow the installation guide given below).
        
        Alternatively, you can download or clone the repository and use `pip` to handle dependencies:
        
        ```
        unzip carat.zip
        pip install -e carat
        ```
        or
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/carat/carat.git
        pip install -e carat
        ```
        
        By calling `pip list` you should see `carat` now as an installed pacakge:
        ```
        carat (0.x.x, /path/to/carat)
        ```
        
        ### Hints for the Installation
        
        `carat` uses `librosa` to load audio files.
        
        `librosa` uses `soundfile` and `audioread` to load audio files.
        Note that `soundfile` does not currently support MP3, which will cause librosa to
        fall back on the `audioread` library.
        
        #### soundfile
        
        If you're using `pip` on a Linux environment, you may need to install `libsndfile`
        manually.  Please refer to the [SoundFile installation documentation](https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/#installation) for details.
        
        #### audioread and MP3 support
        
        To fuel `audioread` with more audio-decoding power (e.g., for reading MP3 files),
        you may need to install either *ffmpeg* or *GStreamer*.
        
        *Note that on some platforms, `audioread` needs at least one of the programs to work properly.*
        
        Here are some common commands for different operating systems:
        
        * Linux (apt-get): `apt-get install ffmpeg` or `apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`
        * Linux (yum): `yum install ffmpeg` or `yum install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`
        * Mac: `brew install ffmpeg` or `brew install gstreamer`
        * Windows: download binaries from the website
        
        For GStreamer, you also need to install the Python bindings with
        ```
        pip install pygobject
        ```
