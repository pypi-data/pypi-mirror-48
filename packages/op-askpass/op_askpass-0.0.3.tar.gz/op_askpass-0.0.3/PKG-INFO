Description: # op_askpass
        
        Load password-protected ssh keys to your agent without prompts using 1Password.
        
        Currently tested on Ubuntu only.
        
        ## Getting started
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install op_askpass
        # This installs 1Password cli locally.
        $ op-askpass setup-op-client my.1password.com my_username@gmail.com
        $ op-askpass add-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa "my 1Password item name"
        # This fetches the password from 1Password and calls ssh-add.
        $ op-askpass login my
        ```
        
        ## Details
        
        `op-askpass` stores a small configuration file and 1Password cli called `op`
        in your `$HOME/.op-askpass` directory.
        
        The configuration file contains a mapping from ssh key fingerprint to key path
        and 1Password item name. The key path is needed for loading the key when
        calling `op-askpass login`. The item name is looked up for password and
        provided instead of prompt.
        
        Underneath, `op-askpass` uses `SSH_ASKPASS` command to override prompt and
        instead provide the password from 1Password. The only prompt is during `op-askpass login`
        to 1Password to retrieve a 30-minutes long session key.
        
        You can list keys added to `op-askpass` using `list-keys` command, and delete not needed
        ones with `op-askpass delete-key <path_to_key>`.
        
        
        ### 1Password domain name
        
        For regular, non-company users the 1Password domain is `my.1password.com`. For
        company users it is usually `company.1password.com`.
