Cleaning
========

Why do we need it?
------------------

Because we constantly need to clean files which are not needed before starting a new test,
we embedded our cleaning logic.

How does it work?
-----------------

.. note::
    Want to read the code ? It's here :func:`PyFunceble.clean.Clean`!

It has an internal map of what has to be deleted and how.

How to clean?
-------------

For a simple clean, run PyFunceble with the :code:`--clean` argument.

For a complete cleaning, run PyFunceble with the :code:`--clean-all` argument.


Differences between simple and complete cleaning?
-------------------------------------------------

The :code:`--clean` logic only cleans the :code:`output/` directory.

The :code:`--clean-all` delete all files generated which are not useful for future usage.

.. note::
    :code:`--clean-all` does not delete the following files even if generated by us.

    * :code:`.pyfunceble-env`
    * :code:`whois_db.json`
