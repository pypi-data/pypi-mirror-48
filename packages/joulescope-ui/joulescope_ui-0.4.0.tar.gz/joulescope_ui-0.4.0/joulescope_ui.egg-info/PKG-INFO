Description: 
        # Joulescope UI
        
        Welcome to Joulescope™!  Joulescope is an affordable, precision DC energy 
        analyzer that enables you to build better products.
        Joulescope™ accurately and simultaneously measures the voltage and current 
        supplied to your target device, and it then computes power and energy. 
        For more information on Joulescope, see 
        [www.joulescope.com](https://www.joulescope.com).
        
        This repository contains the Joulescope graphical user interface (UI).
        The UI runs on a host computer and communicates with the Joulescope device 
        over USB.  The application source code is available at 
        https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui.  
        
        For the list of changes by release, see the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
        
        The Joulescope UI is under active development, and many features remain 
        outstanding. See the [future features document](features_future.md) for details.
        
        
        ## Quick start
        
        Most Joulescope users will want to 
        [download](https://www.joulescope.com/download) the application.  The
        packages are available at pypi, but this project uses a forked version of
        pyqtgraph which you will need to install manually.
        
        
        ## Developer
        
        Start by following getting the Joulescope package running using the instructions
        located in the [joulescope README](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope).
        
        Install python3 dependencies
        
            pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        
        As of May 2019, this package depends upon a 
        [forked version of pyqtgraph](https://github.com/jetperch/pyqtgraph) which
        is automatically installed from the Joulescope website.
            
        If you are just interested in developing the UI, you can install the joulescope
        package as described in the 
        [joulescope README](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope). 
        However, if you want to develop both, you can modify your pythonpath.
        
        On Windows:
        
            set PYTHONPATH=C:\path\to\pyjoulescope;C:\path\to\pyjoulescope_ui;
        
            
        ### Linux
        
        Install QT5 tools
        
            sudo apt install qtcreator qt5-default qt5-doc qt5-doc-html qtbase5-doc-html qtbase5-examples
