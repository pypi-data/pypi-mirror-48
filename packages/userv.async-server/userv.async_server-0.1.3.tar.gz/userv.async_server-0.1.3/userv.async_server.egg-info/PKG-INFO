Description: The catch
        =========
        Simple async webserver
        
        Webserver
        =========
        first we need to add routes to a router.
        Atm creating json or text responses is part of the webserver but will be generalised to the core
        in future.
        
        First we add a server task to the event loop
        Example:
        ::
        
            from userv.routing import Router
            from userv.async_server import App
            router = Router()
        
            web_server = App(router)
            web_server.run_task()
        
        
        Now we have added the current app to the event loop and stll work on other tasks.
        It will be run when we trigger the loop.run as all async tasks should.
