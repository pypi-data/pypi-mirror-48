        Installing dependencies
        -----------------------
        
        Because **neurotic** depends on some pre-release changes in a couple libraries,
        ``pip`` cannot automatically fetch all dependencies during normal installation.
        Therefore, **dependencies must be installed manually**.
        
        With conda
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A recipe for installing **neurotic** via ``conda`` directly is not yet
        available. However, the file ``environment.yml`` is provided for installing its
        dependencies into a conda environment. To install into a new conda environment
        named ``neurotic``, use these commands::
        
            git clone https://github.com/jpgill86/neurotic.git
            conda env create -f neurotic/environment.yml -n neurotic
        
        To update an existing environment, replace ``conda env create`` with ``conda
        env update``.
        
        Remember to switch environments if necessary before proceeding with
        installation (``conda activate neurotic`` or ``source activate neurotic``).
        
        Without conda
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The file ``requirements.txt`` is provided for installing dependencies with
        ``pip``. Dependencies can be installed using these commands::
        
            git clone https://github.com/jpgill86/neurotic.git
            pip install -U -r neurotic/requirements.txt
        
        If you get an error while installing PyAV, especially on Windows, you may need
        to build it from scratch or get it from another source, such as conda-forge::
        
            conda install -c conda-forge av
        
        Installing neurotic
        -------------------
        
        To reiterate, you must install dependencies manually. They will not be
        installed with **neurotic**.
        
        To install the latest release version from PyPI_, use ::
        
            pip install neurotic
        
        To install the latest development version from GitHub_, use ::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/jpgill86/neurotic.git
        
        To install from a local copy of the source code, use ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Launch the standalone app from the command line::
        
            neurotic
        
        A simple example is provided. Select the "example dataset", download the
        associated data, and then click launch.
        
        Command line arguments can be listed using ::
        
            neurotic --help
