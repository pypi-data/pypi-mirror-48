    This is an example consumer that will handle unexpected interactions
    with RabbitMQ such as channel and connection closures.

    If RabbitMQ closes the connection, this class will stop and indicate
    that reconnection is necessary. You should look at the output, as
    there are limited reasons why the connection may be closed, which
    usually are tied to permission related issues or socket timeouts.

    If the channel is closed, it will indicate a problem with one of the
    commands that were issued and that should surface in the output as well.
