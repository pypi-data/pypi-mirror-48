This is a WIP project for 3d human models, especially [SMPL](http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/). SMPL model has so much impact in the community that I admire and am eager to understand.

This is an educational project to learn about the SMPL models by implementing them from scratch.

The main goal of this project is to:

- Provide a getting started playground to work with 3d human models.
- Detailed understand of the [SMPL](http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) -> [SMPLify](http://smplify.is.tue.mpg.de/) -> [SMPL-x](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/)

# FAQ

## **Can I use this project in commercial projects?**
I have no idea. Please check with your lawyer.

Here are my thoughts:

- SMPL models are non-commercial. Here is the [SMPL-Model License](http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/license_model).
- Most of the code in this repository is Apache License so you may use it as you want. However, it is inspired by the code from [SMPL Project](http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) so it may be considered as derivative works. I don't have expertise in this area.

## **Is this production-ready?**
No. The focus of this project is for my understanding of human models. You can use this with your own risk.

For production purpose, I am highly recommend that you contact [SMPL's authors](http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/faq) for high-quality models and expertise.
