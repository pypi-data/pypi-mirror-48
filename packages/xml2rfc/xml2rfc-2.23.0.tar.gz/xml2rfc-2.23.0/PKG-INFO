Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.23.0 (27 Jun 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release adds v2v3 support for conversion of v2 code with both text and
          external image sources to v3 <artset> format, and provides improved cache
          handling.  It also contains a long list of bugfixes.  Here is an excerpt
          from the commit log:
        
          * Fixed an issue where cache clearing did not consider custom cache 
            locations.
        
          * Added retry on connection error for external includes.  This fixes an
            issue which has appearing more often recently, where the first connection
            to fetch a reference file has failed to provide the right redirect.
        
          * Added inclusion of metadata.js in the html renderer, for future handling
            of dynamic metadata (updated-by and obsoleted-by information, for
            instance).  Added a default instance of the metadata javascript file to
            the distribution, and added an command-line option to specify an
            alternative version of the javascript metadata script.
        
          * Added <script> to the list of elements treated as blocks for HTML output
            formatting purposes.
        
          * Show 'US' as "United States of America" (official name rather than short 
            name according to ISO 3166-1)
        
          * Changed the default RFC base URL in run.py, and the extension used in 
            html.py.
        
          * Added code to the v2v3 converter to create an <artset> for legacy 
            artwork with both a 'src' attribute and text content.
        
          * Changed <reference> rendering when part of a <referencegroup> to not 
            include the DOI.
        
          * Fixed a crash that could occur during index building with multiple levels
            of <references>.
        
          * Tweaked the text format <artwork> placeholder (when no text format 
            artwork is present) to look at both 'src' and 'originalSrc' for an URL
            for alternative artwork.
        
          * Changed the handling of pilcrow links at end of paragraphs and similar 
            to follow immediately after the content, without wrappable space, to avoid 
            the appearence of having double blandk lines when the pilcrow would be 
            wrapped to sit by itself on a line.
        
          * Added a HTML div to hold artset anchor, fixing an issue where artset
            anchors would not always be present.
        
          * Refined the preptool warnings regarding artset/artwork anchor handling.
        
          * Eliminated toc update work when tocInclude is false.
        
          * Only apply validation of cache entries as references if they are 
            <reference> entries.
        
          * Refined the reference URL cache handling for URLs with query arguments, 
            to avoid cache collisions.
        
          * Eliminated an incorrect check for page break after section header at end
            of document.  Fixes issue #409.
        
          * Handled authors without address elements for v3 text.  Fixes issue #408.
        
          * Dealt better with <workgroup> without content.
        
          * Changed the schema to require at least one instance of <artwork> within 
            <artset>.  Fixes issue #405.
        
          * Added a default rendering (code point number) for code points without 
            unicode code point names.  Fixes issues #401 and #402.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.22.3 (08 Apr 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release brings further tweaks and imporvements to the v3 text
          format output in the area of Table of Content formatting, and fixes a
          number of bugs.
        
          * Tweaked the handling of ToC page numbers in the v3 text format.
        
          * Tweaked the xml inserted by the preptool for the ToC to give ToC
            indentation and spacing which better match the legacy text format
            (and also looks better).
        
          * Added a rewrite of <svg> viewBox values to the simplest acceptable
            format, to make sure it will be understood by our pdf generation libs.
        
          * Added a test case for <xref section=...>
        
          * Tweaked the section label for fragment <xref> rendering to say
            'Appendix' instead of 'Section' for appendix references.
        
          * Added a pre-rfc1272 reference to elements.xml to test the author
            initials handling for early RFCs.
        
          * Tweaked the get_initials() code for use on <reference> authors.
            Refactored part of the text.render_reference() code to support
            get_initials() properly.
        
          * Added special initials handling for RFCs 1272 and below, to apply the
            single initials handling enforced at that time.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.22.2 (27 Mar 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release fixes a couple of issues discovered by users who are now
          starting to excercise the v3 processing chain.  Thanks for reporting
          bugs!  From the commit log:
        
          * Fixed an issue with xref rendering where the 'pageno' parameter had 
            been given a non-numeric default value.  Fixes issue #399.
        
          * Removed an unnecessary docker volume binding.
        
          * Added slightly more verbosity when converting v2v3, and tweaked an 
            import statement.
        
          * Fixed an issue with <references> sections where duplicate name entries 
            could be created during the prep phase, leading to schema validation 
            failure.  Fixes issue #398.
