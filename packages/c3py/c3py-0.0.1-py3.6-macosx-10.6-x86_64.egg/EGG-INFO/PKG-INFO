Description: The Compressed Continuous Computation (C3) package is intended to make it easy to perform continuous linear and multilinear algebra with multidimensional functions. It works by representing multidimensional functions in a low-rank format. Common tasks include taking continuous matrix decompositions of vector- or matrix-valued functions, adding or multiplying functions together, integrating multidimensional functions, and much much more.
Keywords: highd-approximation machine-learning uncertainty-quantification tensors
