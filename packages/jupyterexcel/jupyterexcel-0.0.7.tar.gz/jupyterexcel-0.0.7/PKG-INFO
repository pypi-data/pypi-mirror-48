            jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterexcel
        
        ## Server setting
        
        Please config [jupyter server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html) like the following:
        ```
        c.NotebookApp.token = 'ABCD'   #it is good to use token mode for web api call to pass through
        ```
        ## Example
        The following screenshot shows the sample notebook file with a function sum. You can download TestingJupyter.ipynb or create your own.  The following is an instance I hosted in google cloud platform, you can open and add a function of yours.
        '''
        http://34.73.64.35:8888/Excel/TestingJupyter.ipynb?token=ABCD&functionname=sum&1=11&2=8&3=6
        http://34.73.64.35:8888/notebooks/TestingJupyter.ipynb

        ## Future Development Plan
        1. Make jupyterexcel can take Post call for large data from Excel and handle Array formula
        2. Make Excel client side more easier to use, such as generate Excel formula proxy
        3. Possible add ribbon in Excel and call into Jupyter function with button click
        4. Able to support R, Julia ....
