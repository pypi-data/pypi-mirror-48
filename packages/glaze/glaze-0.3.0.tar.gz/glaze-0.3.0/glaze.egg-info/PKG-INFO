        ## Demo
        
        ```python
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> from glaze import read_json, render
        >>>
        >>> font = read_json("data/Georgia.json")
        >>> font_name, glyph_name, glyph = font[0]
        >>> render(glyph)
        >>> plt.show()
        ```

        ## Installation
        
        The latest release of `glaze` can be installed from PyPI:
        
        ```bash
        pip install glaze
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use `glaze` as a library:
        
        ```python
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from glaze import render
        
        fig = render(contours)  # Render one glyph
        ```
        
        To run `glaze` on the command line:
        
        ```bash
        # Recommended usage
        glaze --directory PATH/TO/DATA/
        
        # Alternative usage
        glaze --files FILES
        ```
        
        1. The `--directory` must have the following structure:
        
           ```bash
           data
           ├── json
           │   ├── Georgia.json
           │   └── ...
           └── ...
           ```
        
           where the `.json` files are those produced by `knead`. Renders will be saved
           in a directory `data/renders-TTTT-DD-MM/`, where `TTTT` is military time.
        
        1. However, should you want to render only a few files, you can use the
           `--files` flag, which must be one of:
            * a path to a `.json` file (again, such as those produced by `knead`),
            * a comma-separated list of such paths, or
            * a regex matching the path(s) to one or more `.json` files.
        
          Renders will be saved in the present working directory (unless [the `--output`
          flag](https://font-bakers.github.io/glaze/quickstart/#optional-flags) is
          passed).
        
        Refer to our [quickstart](https://font-bakers.github.io/glaze/quickstart/) for
        more information on how to use `glaze`.
