**Diffusion Approximation for Demographic Inference**

∂a∂i implements methods for demographic history and selection inference from genetic data, based on diffusion approximations to the allele frequency spectrum. One of ∂a∂i's main benefits is speed: fitting a two-population model typically takes around 10 minutes, and run time is independent of the number of SNPs in your data set. ∂a∂i is also flexible, handling up to three simultaneous populations, with arbitrary timecourses for population size and migration, plus the possibility of admixture and population-specific selection.

Originally ∂a∂i was initially developed by  Ryan Gutenkunst in the labs of Scott Williamson and Carlos Bustamante [http://www.bustamantelab.org] in Cornell's Department of Biological Statistics and Computational Biology. Ryan is now faculty in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Arizona, and his group continues to work on ∂a∂i [http://gutengroup.mcb.arizona.edu].

If you use ∂a∂i in your research, please cite RN Gutenkunst, RD Hernandez, SH Williamson, CD Bustamante "Inferring the joint demographic history of multiple populations from multidimensional SNP data" PLoS Genetics 5:e1000695 (2009).
