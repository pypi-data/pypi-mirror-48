    "\n",
    "When exploring data it can be convenient to use the `.plot` API to quickly visualize a particular dataset. By calling `.plot` to generate different plots over the course of a session, it is possible to build up a mental model of how a high dimensional dataset is structured. While this can work well for relatively simple datasets, it can be more efficient to gain insights by building a linked visualization that supports direct user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the workflow presented here, building such custom interaction is relatively quick and easy and does not involve throwing away prior code used to generate simpler plots. In the spirit of 'short cuts not dead ends', we can use the HoloViews output of `hvplot` that we used in our initial exploration to build rich visualizations with custom interaction to explore our data at a deeper level. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the earthquakes plotted were either filtered early on by magnitude (`>=7`) or dynamically to analyse only the earthquakes within a small geographic distance. This allowed us to use Bokeh directly without any special handing and without having to worry about the performance issues that would be occur if we were to try to render the whole dataset at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we will see how such large datasets can be directly visualized using datashader."
