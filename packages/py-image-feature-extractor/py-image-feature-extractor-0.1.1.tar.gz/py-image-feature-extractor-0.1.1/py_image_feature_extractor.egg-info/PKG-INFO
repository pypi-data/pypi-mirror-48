Description: 
        This package provides implementations of different methods to perform image feature extraction. These methods are
        though a Python package and a command line interface. Available feature extraction methods are:
        
        - Convolutional Neural Networks
          
          - VGG-19
          - ResNet-50
          - DenseNet-50
          - Custom CNN through .h5 file
        
        - Linear Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH)
        
        - Bag of Features (bag-of-visual-words)
        
          - SIFT
          - SURF
          - KAZE
