About
-----

This directory contains a bundled version of VisPy. Since the release cycle is
quite slow, and we need some of the latest fixes, it is easier to bundle the
latest developer version than require users to install the latest developer
version. The license for VisPy is given in the VISPY_LICENSE.txt file in this
directory.
