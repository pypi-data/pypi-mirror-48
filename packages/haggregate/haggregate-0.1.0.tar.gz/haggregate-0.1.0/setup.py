# Running setup.py requires having installed numpy and Cython. There are some
# complicated solutions that might make it possible to somehow add them to
# "setup_requirements" etc., but I decided they aren't worth it. We'd better wait until
# Python has better packaging tools (this shouldn't need more than 100 more years).
