# 01-filter.rules
#
# Jinja2 template for iptables
# The naming scheme is important. You can prefix the table name with a number
# to specify the order in which the files are loaded. The name after '-'
# is the table name the rules are applied upon. If the table is suffixed with a
# '6' the rules are applied to ip6tables. Recognized file endings are rules
# and fallback. Fallback files are applied before connecting to a nordvpn server
# and after disconnecting. Rules files are applied after connecting to a nordvpn 
# server.
#
# Recognized variables which must not be present in the config file:
# vpn_remote:   the remote ip address of the vpn server
# vpn_protocol: the protocol in use: udp or tcp
# vpn_port:     the port to communicate with the vpn server
#
# In addition to variables above which are exposed from connord there are a lot
# of variables available from openvpn's environment. They can be seen
# in the output of connord when not running in daemon mode and are well 
# documented in man 8 openvpn in the 'Environment Variables' section.
#
# This file is parsed from top to bottom so make sure chains and rules are in
# right order. Chains are created if they are not present yet.
#
# An unindented line defines a chain.
# policy: Policy like it is described in man iptables
# action: Not used yet
# rules:  List of rules in the format which is accepted by python-iptables. See
#         documentation there.
