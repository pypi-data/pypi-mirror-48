   :alt: Clamor is a Python framework for the Discord API.

Clamor is easy to use, simple and expressive. `anyio <https://github.com/agronholm/anyio>`_ for underlying async I/O
makes the library compatible to `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_,
`trio <https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ and
`curio <https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ backends and is therefore really flexible.
