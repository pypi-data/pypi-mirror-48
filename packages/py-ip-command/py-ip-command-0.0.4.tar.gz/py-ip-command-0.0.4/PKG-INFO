        This is still work in progess, but you can already use it. Help is very welcome!
        
        Usage
        -----
        At the moment only two commands of `ip` are implemented.
        
        Just use 
        ```python
        from ip_command.ip import IP
         ```
        and then you can issue commands like 
         ```bash
         ip addr show
         ``` 
         with
         ```python
        IP.addr.show()
        ```
        or 
        ```bash 
        ip neigh show
        ```
        with
        ```python
        IP.neigh.show()
        ```
        The return of both is 
        * An object oriented representation of the data reurned by both commands
        * a dict (addr) or a list of dicts (neigh) consisting of all the information the commands return but split 
        into single elements, if you pass `as_dict=True` to `show()` or simply call `show(True)`
