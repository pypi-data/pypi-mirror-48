        ##Date to Star Trek TNG star date converter
        
        This package is meant to convert an existing date to a stardate similar to Star Trek : The Next Generation.  It is feature complete in that regard.  I would like to add more options and different packages to this eventually.  If you want to work on something feel free to make a pull request and submit your own changes.
        
        ###Roadmap
        	- 1. Add additional timelines
        	- 2. Create additional plugins for various other sources(gnome shell, kde, pelican, wordpress)
