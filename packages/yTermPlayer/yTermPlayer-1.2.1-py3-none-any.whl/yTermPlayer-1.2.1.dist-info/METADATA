### FAQ
- How to fix out of range/url not found errors?

YouTube keeps changing its structure so it's important you have installed the latest version of youtube-dl as follows:
` pip install --upgrade youtube_dl `

- Where are my playlists stored and how to delete playlists?

Playlists are saved in `$HOME/.yTermPlayer/playlists` as plain text. You may delete or add new playlists directly here.

### Known Bugs
- ~~Buggy / unexpected playback behavior~~
It was caused because of race conditions and absence of critical section among the threads. Fixed it using semaphores

- ~~If some VLC error starts showing up on the screen, just resize the terminal and it will be gone~~
Completely removed VLC and replaced it with much more minimal and faster mpv player. Thank to [python-mpv by jaseg](https://github.com/jaseg/python-mpv)
