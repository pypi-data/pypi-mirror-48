Description: # azuredlock
        
        azure + redlock onboarding script.
        
        This is mainly just a wrapper around the `az cli` which is a dependency.
        
        The quickest path is to do a `pip install azuredlock` and then
        run `azuredlock onboard` from the Azure Cloud Shell which is in the 
        Azure Portal since it already has the cli and uses a form of 
        Managed Identities so you don't even have to login for it to work.
