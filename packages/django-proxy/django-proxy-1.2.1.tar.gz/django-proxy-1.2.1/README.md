Django HTTP Proxy
=================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mjumbewu/django-proxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mjumbewu/django-proxy)

**Simple HTTP proxy service as a Django app.**

**Author:** Mjumbe Wawatu Ukweli, [Follow me on Twitter][1].

Installation
============

Install with

```console
$ pip install django-proxy
```

Overview
========

Forward as close to an exact copy of the request as possible along to a
given url.  Respond with as close to an exact copy of the resulting
response as possible.

Includes a view function that can be used directly from a URL spec:

```python
from proxy.views import proxy_view

urlpatterns = patterns(
	...
	url('proxy/(?P<url>.*)', proxy_view),
	...
)
```

Or from another view function:

```python
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
from proxy.views import proxy_view

@csrf_exempt
def myview(request, path):
	extra_requests_args = {...}
	remoteurl = 'http://<host_name>/' + path
	return proxy_view(request, remoteurl, extra_requests_args)

urlpatterns = patterns(
	...
	url('proxy/(?P<path>.*)', myview),
	...
)
```
