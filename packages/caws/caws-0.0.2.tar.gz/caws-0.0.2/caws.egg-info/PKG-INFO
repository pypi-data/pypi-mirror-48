Description: # caws  
          
        configure AWS responsibly using profile names and environment vars.  
          
        rather than changing your AWS SDK credentials with `aws configure`, AWS suggests  
        setting the ENV var AWS\_DEFAULT\_PROFILE to a [profile] in your ~/.aws/credentials.  
        when set, this ENV var will over-ride the profile set with `aws configure`.  
          
        caws will write to an rc file setting AWS\_DEFAULT\_PROFILE to the given profile name.   
        if you do not have the rc file caws will create it for you.  
          
        *you'll need to add `. .cawsrc` to your RC file (using bash: .bashrc or .bash\_profile)*  
          
        add new profiles using `$ aws configure --profile newname`   
          
        one benefit of using AWS\_DEFAULT\_PROFILE method instead of `aws configure` is the   
        ability to add which AWS profile you're currently using to your command prompt.
