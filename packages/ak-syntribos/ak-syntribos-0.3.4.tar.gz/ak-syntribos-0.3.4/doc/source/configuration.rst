=============
Configuration
=============

All configuration files should have at least the section
``[syntribos]``. Depending upon what extensions you are using
and what you are testing, you can add other sections as well.
For example, if you are using the built-in identity extension
you would also need the ``[user]`` section. The sections
``[logging]`` and ``[remote]`` are optional.

Given below is the basic structure of a syntribos configuration
file.

::

    [syntribos]
    #
    # End point URLs and versions of the services to be tested.
    #
    endpoint=http://localhost:5000
    # Set payload and templates path
    templates=<location_of_templates_dir/file>
    payloads=<location_of_payloads_dir>

    [user]
    #
    # User credentials and endpoint URL to get an AUTH_TOKEN
    # This section is only needed if you are using the identity extension.
    #
    endpoint=
    username=<yourusername>
    password=<yourpassword>

    [remote]
    #
    # Optional, to define remote URI and cache_dir explicitly
    #
    templates_uri=<URI to a tar file of set of templates>
    payloads_uri=<URI to a tar file of set of payloads>
    cache_dir=<a local path to save the downloaded files>

    [logging]
    log_dir=<location_to_save_debug_logs>


To test any project, just update the endpoint URL under
``[syntribos]`` to point to the API and also modify the user
credentials if needed. The endpoint URL in the ``[syntribos]``
section  is the one being tested by syntribos and the endpoint URL in
``[user]`` section is just used to get an AUTH_TOKEN.

Downloading templates and payloads remotely
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Payload and template files can be downloaded remotely in syntribos.
In the config file under ``[syntribos]`` section, if ``templates``
and ``payloads`` options are not set, then, by default syntribos will
download all the latest payloads and the templates for a few OpenStack
projects.

As a user you can specify a URI to download custom templates and payloads
from as well; this is done by using ``[remotes]`` section in the config file.
Available options under ``[remotes]`` are ``cache_dir``, ``templates_uri``,
``payloads_uri`` and ``enable_cache``. The ``enable_cache`` option is
``True`` by default and can be set to ``False`` to disable caching of remote
content while syntribos is running. If the ``cache_dir`` set to a path,
syntribos will attempt to use that as a base directory to save downloaded
template and payload files.

The advantage of using these options are that you will be able to get
the latest payloads from the official repository and if you are
using syntribos to test OpenStack projects, then, in most cases you
could directly use the well defined templates available with this option.

This option also helps to easily manage different versions of templates
remotely, without the need to maintain a set of different versions offline.

Testing OpenStack keystone API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sample config file is given in ``examples/configs/keystone.conf``.
Copy this file to a location of your choice (default file path for
configuration file is: ``~/.syntribos/syntribos.conf``) and update the
necessary fields like user credentials, log, template directory etc.

::

    $ vi examples/configs/keystone.conf
