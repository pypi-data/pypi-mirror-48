Syntribos is an open source automated API security testing tool that is
maintained by members of the `OpenStack Security Project <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security>`__.

Given a simple configuration file and an example HTTP request, syntribos
can replace any API URL, URL parameter, HTTP header and request body
field with a given set of strings. Syntribos iterates through each position
in the request automatically. Syntribos aims to automatically detect common
security defects such as SQL injection, LDAP injection, buffer overflow, etc. In
addition, syntribos can be used to help identify new security defects
by automated fuzzing.

Syntribos has the capability to test any API, but is designed with
`OpenStack <https://www.openstack.org/>`__ applications in mind.

List of Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Syntribos is shipped with batteries included, which means, with minimal
configuration effort you can initiate automated testing of any API of
your choice. If testing OpenStack API is in your mind, then syntribos
by default will help you in automatically downloading a set of templates
of some of the bigger OpenStack projects like nova, neutron, keystone etc.

A short list of tests that can be run using syntribos is given below:

* Buffer Overflow
* Command Injection
* CORS Wildcard
* Integer Overflow
* LDAP Injection
* SQL Injection
* String Validation
* XML External Entity
* Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )

Buffer Overflow
---------------

The idea of `buffer overflow attacks`_ in the context of a web application
is to force an application to handle more data than it can hold in a buffer.
In syntribos a buffer overflow test is attempted by injecting a large
string into the body of an HTTP request.

Command Injection
-----------------

`Command injection attacks`_ are done by injecting arbitrary commands in an
attempt to execute these commands on a remote system. In syntribos, this is
achieved by injecting a set of strings that have been proven to be successful
in executing a command injection attacks.

CORS Wildcard
-------------

`CORS wildcard test`_ is used to verify if a web server allows cross-domain
resource sharing from any external URL ( wild carding of
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header) rather than a white list of URLs.

Integer Overflow
----------------

`Integer overflow test`_ in syntribos attempts to inject numeric values that
the remote application may fail to represent within its storage, for example
a 32 bit integer type trying to store a 64 bit number

LDAP Injection
--------------

Syntribos attempts `LDAP injection attacks`_ by injecting LDAP statements
into HTTP requests; if an application fails to properly sanitize the
request content, it may be possible to execute arbitrary commands.

SQL Injection
-------------

`SQL injection attacks`_ are one of the most common web application attacks.
If the user input is not properly sanitized, it is fairly easy to
execute SQL queries that may result in an attacker reading  sensitive
information or gaining control of the SQL server. In syntribos
an application is tested for SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting
SQL strings into the HTTP request.

String Validation
-----------------

String validation attacks in syntribos try to exploit the fact that
some string patterns are not sanitized effectively by the input
validator and may cause the application to crash. Examples of characters
that may cause string validation vulnerabilities are special unicode
characters, emojis etc.

XML External Entity
-------------------

`XML external entity attacks`_ are attacks that targets the web
application's XML parser. If an XML parser allows processing of
external entities referenced in an XML document then an attacker
might be able to cause denial of service, leakage of information etc.
Syntribos tries to inject a few malicious strings into an XML body
while sending requests to an application in an attempt to obtain an
appropriate response.

Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )
----------------------------
An XSS_ attack is one where malicious JavaScript is injected into a web
application. Syntribos tries to find potential XSS issues by injecting
string containing "script" and other HTML tags into request fields.

Other than these built-in tests, you can extend syntribos by writing
your own custom tests. To do this, download the source code and look at
the tests in ``syntribos/tests`` directory. The CORS test may be an easy
one to emulate. In the same way, users can add different extensions also
to the tests. To see how extensions can be written please see
``syntribos/extensions`` directory.

============
Installation
============

Syntribos can be installed directly from `pypi with pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__

::

   pip install syntribos

If you want the latest changes, you could install syntribos from `source <https://www.github.com/openstack/syntribos.git>`__
with `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__.

-  Clone the repository

::

   $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/syntribos.git

- cd to the directory and install with pip

::

   $ cd syntribos
   $ pip install .

======================================
Initializing the syntribos Environment
======================================

Once syntribos is installed, you must initialize the syntribos environment.
This can be done manually, or via the ``init`` command.

::

    $ syntribos init

By default, ``syntribos init`` fetches a set of default payload files from a
`remote repository maintained by our development team <https://github.com/rahulunair/syntribos-payloads>`_.
These payload files are necessary for our fuzz tests to run, but if you would
like to disable this behavior, run syntribos with the ``--no_downloads`` flag.
Payload files can also be fetched by running ``syntribos download --payloads``
at any time.

If you'd like to specify a custom root for syntribos to be installed in,
specify the ``--custom_install_root`` flag after ``init``. This will skip
syntribos' prompts for information from the terminal, which can be handy for
Jenkins jobs and other situations where user input cannot be retrieved.

If you've already run the ``init`` command but want to start over with a fresh
environment, you can specify the ``--force`` flag to overwrite existing files.
The ``--custom_install_root`` and ``--force`` flags can be combined to overwrite
files in a custom install root.

**Example:**

::

    $ syntribos init --custom_install_root /your/custom/path --force



=============
Configuration
=============

All configuration files should have at least the section
``[syntribos]``. Depending upon what extensions you are using
and what you are testing, you can add other sections as well.
For example, if you are using the built-in identity extension
you would also need the ``[user]`` section. The sections
``[logging]`` and ``[remote]`` are optional.

Given below is the basic structure of a syntribos configuration
file.

::

    [syntribos]
    #
    # End point URLs and versions of the services to be tested.
    #
    endpoint=http://localhost:5000
    # Set payload and templates path
    templates=<location_of_templates_dir/file>
    payloads=<location_of_payloads_dir>

    [user]
    #
    # User credentials and endpoint URL to get an AUTH_TOKEN
    # This section is only needed if you are using the identity extension.
    #
    endpoint=
    username=<yourusername>
    password=<yourpassword>

    [remote]
    #
    # Optional, to define remote URI and cache_dir explicitly
    #
    templates_uri=<URI to a tar file of set of templates>
    payloads_uri=<URI to a tar file of set of payloads>
    cache_dir=<a local path to save the downloaded files>

    [logging]
    log_dir=<location_to_save_debug_logs>


To test any project, just update the endpoint URL under
``[syntribos]`` to point to the API and also modify the user
credentials if needed. The endpoint URL in the ``[syntribos]``
section  is the one being tested by syntribos and the endpoint URL in
``[user]`` section is just used to get an AUTH_TOKEN.

Downloading templates and payloads remotely
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Payload and template files can be downloaded remotely in syntribos.
In the config file under ``[syntribos]`` section, if ``templates``
and ``payloads`` options are not set, then, by default syntribos will
download all the latest payloads and the templates for a few OpenStack
projects.

As a user you can specify a URI to download custom templates and payloads
from as well; this is done by using ``[remotes]`` section in the config file.
Available options under ``[remotes]`` are ``cache_dir``, ``templates_uri``,
``payloads_uri`` and ``enable_cache``. The ``enable_cache`` option is
``True`` by default and can be set to ``False`` to disable caching of remote
content while syntribos is running. If the ``cache_dir`` set to a path,
syntribos will attempt to use that as a base directory to save downloaded
template and payload files.

The advantage of using these options are that you will be able to get
the latest payloads from the official repository and if you are
using syntribos to test OpenStack projects, then, in most cases you
could directly use the well defined templates available with this option.

This option also helps to easily manage different versions of templates
remotely, without the need to maintain a set of different versions offline.

Testing OpenStack keystone API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sample config file is given in ``examples/configs/keystone.conf``.
Copy this file to a location of your choice (default file path for
configuration file is: ``~/.syntribos/syntribos.conf``) and update the
necessary fields like user credentials, log, template directory etc.

::

    $ vi examples/configs/keystone.conf



    [syntribos]
    #
    # As keystone is being tested in the example, enter your
    #
    # keystone auth endpoint url.
    endpoint=http://localhost:5000
    # Set payload and templates path
    templates=<location_of_templates_dir/file>
    payloads=<location_of_payloads_dir>

    [user]
    #
    # User credentials
    #
    endpoint=http://localhost:5000
    username=<yourusername>
    password=<yourpassword>
    # Optional, only needed if Keystone V3 API is used
    #user_id=<youruserid>
    # Optional, api version if required
    #version=v2.0
    # Optional, for getting scoped tokens
    #user_id=<alt_userid>
    # If user id is not known
    # For V3 API
    #domain_name=<name_of_the_domain>
    #project_name=<name_of_the_project>
    # For Keystone V2 API
    #tenant_name=<name_of_the_project>

    #[alt_user]
    #
    # Optional, Used for cross auth tests (-t AUTH)
    #
    #endpoint=http://localhost:5000
    #username=<alt_username>
    #password=<alt_password>
    # Optional, for getting scoped tokens
    #user_id=<alt_userid>
    # If user id is not known
    # For V3 API
    #domain_name=<name_of_the_domain>
    #project_name=<name_of_the_project>
    # For Keystone V2 API
    #tenant_name=<name_of_the_project>

    [remote]
    #
    # Optional, Used to specify URLs of templates and payloads
    #
    #cache_dir=<a local path to save the downloaded files>
    #templates_uri=https://github.com/your_project/templates.tar
    #payloads_uri=https://github.com/your_project/payloads.tar
    # To disable caching of these remote contents, set the following variable to False
    #enable_caching=True

    [logging]
    #
    # Logger options go here
    #
    log_dir=<location_to_store_log_files>
    # Optional, compresses http_request_content,
    # if you don't want this, set this option to False.
    http_request_compression=True

========
Commands
========

Below are the set of commands that can be specified while
using syntribos.

- **init**

  This command sets up the syntribos environment after installation. It will
  create the necessary folders for templates, payloads, and logs, as well as
  an example configuration file.

  ::

    $ syntribos init

  To learn more about ``syntribos init``, see the installation instructions
  `here <installation.html>`_

- **run**

  This command runs syntribos with the given config options

  ::

    $ syntribos --config-file keystone.conf -t SQL run

- **dry-run**

  This command ensures that the template files given for this run parse
  successfully without errors. It then runs a debug test which sends no
  requests of its own.

  Note: If any external calls referenced inside the template file do make
  requests, the parser will still make those requests even for a dry run.

  ::

    $ syntribos --config-file keystone.conf dry_run

- **list_tests**

  This command will list the names and description of all the tests
  that can be executed by the ``run`` command.

  ::

    $ syntribos --config-file keystone.conf list_tests

- **download**

  This command will download templates and payload files. By default, it will
  download a default set of OpenStack template files (with the --templates
  flag) or our default set of payloads (with the --payloads flag) to your
  syntribos root directory. However, the behavior of this command can be
  configured in the [remote] section of your config file.

  ::

    $ syntribos download --templates

All these commands except init will only work if a configuration file
is specified. If a configuration file is present in the default
path ( ``~/.syntribos/syntribos.conf`` ), then you
do not need to explicitly specify a config file and
can run syntribos using the command ``syntribos run``.

=================
Running syntribos
=================

To run syntribos against all the available tests, just specify the
command ``syntribos`` with the configuration file without
specifying any test type.

::

    $ syntribos --config-file keystone.conf run

Fuzzy-matching test names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to limit syntribos to run a specific test type using
the ``-t`` flag.

::

    $ syntribos --config-file keystone.conf -t SQL run


This will match all tests that contain ``SQL`` in their name
like SQL_INJECTION_HEADERS, SQL_INJECTION_BODY etc.

Specifying a custom root directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you set up the syntribos environment with a custom root (i.e. with
``syntribos init --custom_install_root``), you can point to it with the
``--syntribos-custom_root`` configuration option. Syntribos will look for a
``syntribos.conf`` file inside this directory, and will read further
configuration information from there.

===================
Logging and Results
===================

Two types of logs are generated by syntribos, results and debug logs. While
results log is the representation of results ( collection of issues ) from a
given syntribos run, debug logs contain debugging information captured during
a particular run. Debug logs may include exception messages, warnings, raw
but sanitized request/response data and a few more details as well.
A modified version of Python logger is used for collecting debug logs in
syntribos.

Results Log
~~~~~~~~~~~

The results log as described above is a collection of issues (failures and
errors) generated at the end of a syntribos run. The "failures" key represents
tests that have failed, indicating a possible security vulnerability and the
"errors" key gives us information on any unhandled exceptions such as connection
errors encountered on that run.

An example failure object is seen below:

::

    {
       "defect_type": "xss_strings",
       "description": "The string(s): '[\"<STYLE>@import'http://xss.rocks/xss.css';</STYLE>\"]',
       known to be commonly returned after a successful XSS attack, have been found in the
       response. This could indicate a vulnerability to XSS attacks.",
       "failure_id": 33,
       "instances": [
          {
            "confidence": "LOW",
            "param": {
              "location": "data",
              "method": "POST",
              "type": null,
              "variables": [
                "type",
                "details/name",
              ]
          },
          "severity": "LOW",
          "signals": {
             "diff_signals": [
               "LENGTH_DIFF_OVER"
             ],
             "init_signals": [
               "HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE_JSON",
               "HTTP_STATUS_CODE_2XX_201"
             ],
             "test_signals": [
               "FAILURE_KEYS_PRESENT",
               "HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE_JSON",
               "HTTP_STATUS_CODE_2XX_201",
             ]
          },
          "strings": [
            "<STYLE>@import'http://xss.rocks/xss.css';</STYLE>"
             ]
          }
       ],
       "url": "127.0.0.1/test"
    }


Errors take the form:

::

    ERROR:
    {
      "error": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/test/syntribos/tests/fuzz/base_fuzz.py\",
       line 58, in tearDownClass\n    super(BaseFuzzTestCase, cls).tearDownClass()\n
       File \"/Users/test/syntribos/tests/base.py\", line 166, in tearDownClass\n
       raise sig.data[\"exception\"]\nReadTimeout: HTTPConnectionPool(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080):
       Read timed out. (read timeout=10)\n",
       "test": "tearDownClass (syntribos.tests.fuzz.sql.image_data_image_data_get.template_SQL_INJECTION_HEADERS_sql-injection.txt_str21_model1)"
    }


Debug Logs
~~~~~~~~~~

Debug logs include details about HTTP requests and responses, and other debugging
information like errors and warnings across the project. The default path where
debug logs are saved is ``.syntribos/logs/``. Debug logs are arranged in
directories based on the timestamp and in these directories, in files named
according to the templates.

For example:

::

    $ ls .syntribos/logs/
    2016-09-15_11:06:37.198412 2016-09-16_10:11:37.834892 2016-09-16_13:31:36.362584
    2016-09-15_11:34:33.271606 2016-09-16_10:38:55.820827 2016-09-16_13:36:43.151048
    2016-09-15_11:41:53.859970 2016-09-16_10:39:50.501820 2016-09-16_13:40:23.203920

::

    $ ls .syntribos/logs/2016-09-16_13:31:36.362584
    API_Versions::list_versions_template.log
    API_Versions::show_api_details_template.log
    availability_zones::get_availability_zone_detail_template.log
    availability_zones::get_availability_zone_template.log
    cells::delete_os_cells_template.log
    cells::get_os_cells_capacities_template.log
    cells::get_os_cells_data_template.log

Each log file includes some essential debugging information like the string representation
of the request object, signals and checks used for tests etc.

The request:

::

    ------------
    REQUEST SENT
    ------------
    request method.......: PUT

Debug logs are sanitized to prevent storing secrets to log files.
Passwords and other sensitive information are masked with astericks using a
slightly modified version of `oslo_utils.strutils.mask_password <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.utils/api/strutils.html#oslo_utils.strutils.mask_password>`__

Debug logs also includes body compression, wherein long fuzz strings are
compressed before being written to the logs. The threshold to start data
compression is set to 512 characters. While compression can be turned off
by setting the variable "http_request_compression" under logging section
in the config file to ``False``, it is not recommended.

=============================
Anatomy of a request template
=============================

This section will give you a brief idea on writing templates
and on how to run specific tests. Templates are input files which has
raw http requests and may also be supplemented with variable
data using extensions.

Syntribos template files are ordinary text files containing raw http
requests.

Using external functions in templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These template files can also be supplemented with variable
data, or data retrieved from external sources. This is handled
using 'extensions.'

Extensions are found in ``syntribos/extensions/`` .

Calls to extensions are made in this form:

::

    CALL_EXTERNAL|{extension dot path}:{function}:{arguments}

One example packaged with syntribos enables the tester to obtain an auth
token from keystone. The code is located in ``identity/client.py``

To use this extension, you can add the following to your template file:

::

    X-Auth-Token: CALL_EXTERNAL|syntribos.extensions.identity.client:get_token_v3:["user"]|

The "user" string indicates the data from the configuration file we
added in ``examples/configs/keystone.conf``

Another example is found in ``random_data/client.py`` . This returns a
UUID when random but unique data is needed. This can be used in place of
usernames when fuzzing a create user call.

::

    "username": "CALL_EXTERNAL|syntribos.extensions.random_data.client:get_uuid:[]|"

The extension function can return one value or be used as a generator if
you want it to change for each test.

Built in functions
------------------

Syntribos comes with a slew of utility functions/extensions, these functions can
be used to dynamically inject data into templates.

.. list-table:: **Utility Functions**
   :widths: 15 35 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Parameters
     - Description
   * - hash_it
     - [data, hash_type (optional hash type, default being SHA256)]
     - Returns hashed value of data
   * - hmac_it
     - [data, key, hash_type (optional hash type, default being SHA256)]
     - Returns HMAC based on the has algorithm, data and the key provided
   * - epoch_time
     - [offset (optional integer offset value, default is zero)]
     - Returns the current time minus offset since epoch
   * - utc_datetime
     - []
     - Returns current UTC date time
   * - base64_encode
     - [data]
     - Returns base 64 encoded value of data supplied
   * - url_encode
     - [url]
     - Returns encoded URL

All these utility functions can be called using:

::

    CALL_EXTERNAL|common_utils.client.{method_name}:{comma separated parameters in square brackets}

For example:

::

    "encoded_url": "CALL_EXTERNAL|common_utils.client:url_encode:['http://localhost:5000']|

There are a few other functions that return random values as well, they are:

.. list-table:: **Random Functions**
   :widths: 15 35 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Parameters
     - Description
   * - get_uuid
     - []
     - Returns a random UUID
   * - random_port
     - []
     - Returns random port number between 0 and 65535
   * - random_ip
     - []
     - Returns random ipv4 address
   * - random_mac
     - []
     - Returns random mac address
   * - random_integer
     - [beg (optional beginning value, default is 0), end (optional end value)]
     - Returns an integer value between 0 and 1468029570 by default
   * - random_utc_datetime
     - []
     - Returns random UTC datetime

These can be called using:

::

    CALL_EXTERNAL|random_data.client.{method_name}:{comma separated parameters in square brackets}

For example,

::

    "address": "CALL_EXTERNAL|random_data.client:random_ip:[]|"

Action Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~

While syntribos is designed to test all fields in a request, it can also
ignore specific fields through the use of Action Fields. If you want to
fuzz against a static object ID, use the Action Field indicator as
follows:

::

    "ACTION_FIELD:id": "1a16f348-c8d5-42ec-a474-b1cdf78cf40f"

The ID provided will remain static for every test.

Running a specific test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned above, some tests included with syntribos by default
are LDAP injection, SQL injection, integer overflow, command injection,
XML external entity, reflected cross-site scripting,
Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) wildcard and SSL.

In order to run a specific test, simply use the ``-t, --test-types``
option and provide `syntribos` with a keyword or keywords to match from
the test files located in ``syntribos/tests/``.

For SQL injection tests, use:

::

    $ syntribos --config-file keystone.conf -t SQL

Another example, to run SQL injection tests against the template body only,
use:

::

    $ syntribos --config-file keystone.conf -t SQL_INJECTION_BODY

For all tests against HTTP headers only, use:

::

    $ syntribos --config-file keystone.conf -t HEADERS



===================
Executing unittests
===================

To execute unittests automatically, navigate to the ``syntribos`` root
directory and install the test requirements.

::

    $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt

Now, run

::

    $ python -m unittest discover tests/unit -p "test_*.py"

If you have configured tox you could also do

::

    $ tox -e py27
    $ tox -e py35

This will run all the unittests and give you a result output
containing the status and coverage details of each test.

=======================
Contributing Guidelines
=======================

Syntribos is an open source project and contributions are always
welcome, if you have any questions, we can be found in the
#openstack-security channel on Freenode IRC.

1. Follow all the `OpenStack Style Guidelines <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/hacking/>`__
   (e.g. PEP8, Py3 compatibility)
2. All new classes/functions should have appropriate docstrings in
   `RST format <https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html>`__
3. All new code should have appropriate unittests (place them in the
   ``tests/unit`` folder)
4. Any change you make can be tested using tox:

::

    pip install tox
    tox -e pep8
    tox -e py27
    tox -e py35
    tox -e cover

Anyone wanting to contribute to OpenStack must follow
