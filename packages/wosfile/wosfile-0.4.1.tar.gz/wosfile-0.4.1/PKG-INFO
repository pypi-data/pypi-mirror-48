        **wosfile** is a Python package designed to read and handle data exported from Thomson Reuters Web of Scienceâ„¢. It supports both tab-delimited files and so-called 'plain text' files.
        
        Pros:
        * It has no requirements beyond Python 3.6+ and the standard library.
        * Completely iterator-based, so useful for working with large datasets. At no point should we ever have more than one single record in memory.
        * Simple API: usually one needs just one function `wosfile.records_from()`.
        
        Cons:
        * Pure Python, so might be slow.
        * At the moment, wosfile does little more than reading WoS files and generating *Record* objects for each record. While it does some niceties like parsing address fields, it does not have any analysis functionality.
        
        ## Other Python packages
        
        The following packages also read WoS files (+ sometimes much more):
        * [WOS+](https://pypi.org/project/WOSplus/)
        * [metaknowledge](https://pypi.org/project/metaknowledge/)
        * [wostools](https://pypi.org/project/wostools/)
        
        Other packages query WoS directly through the API and/or by scraping the web interface:
        * [pywos](https://pypi.org/project/pywos/) (elsewhere called [wos-statistics](https://github.com/refraction-ray/wos-statistics))
        * [wos](https://pypi.org/project/wos/)
        * [wosclient](https://pypi.org/project/wosclient/)
