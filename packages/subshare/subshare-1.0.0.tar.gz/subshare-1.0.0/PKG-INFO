Description: # subShare - ShareX linux alternative written in Python.
        
        ## Features:
        
        - Upload files to nextcloud and generate shareable link.
        - Upload textfiles to Hastebin and copy link to clipboard.
        - Capture screenshots both fullscreen and via selection via scrot.
        - Shorten links via Polr (All shared links are automatically shortened via Polr).
        
        ## Summary:
        
        This project began when I couldnt find a suitable linux alternative for ShareX, which I used on windows to capture my screenshots, upload to my Nextcloud and copy a shareable link where I could post onto my blog, Discord and have access to anywhere when away from my computer via Nextcloud.
        
        My workflow for sharing files, images, link and text consists of a few self hosted services. Nextcloud for file uploads, Hastebin for sharing code/text files, Polr for shortening links and Scrot for capturing screenshots. As I couldn't find a suitable option for linux I decided to create my own and wanted to share for whoever else thought useful.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        In the subshare file edit the following variables in accordance to your parameters. As of now ALL of these are required. In the future they will be optional.
