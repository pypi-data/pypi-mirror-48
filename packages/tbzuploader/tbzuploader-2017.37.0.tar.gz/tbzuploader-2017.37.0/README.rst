tbzuploader
===========

Generic http upload tool.

If the http upload was successfull, local files get moved to a "done" sub directory.

The upload is considered successfull by tbzuploader if the servers replies with http status `201 Created <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success>`_

Additional features: Handles pairs of files.

For example you have four files: a.pdf, a.xml, b.pdf, b.xml

The first upload should take a.pdf and a.xml, and the second upload b.pdf and b.xml. See the docs for `--patterns`.

Example
=======

::

    user@host> tbzuploader my-local-dir https://user:password@myhost/upload-files

This will upload files from directory "my-local-dir" to the specified URL. If the upload was successful (server returned http status "201 created"),
then the local files in "my-local-dir" get moved to "my-local-dir/done".
