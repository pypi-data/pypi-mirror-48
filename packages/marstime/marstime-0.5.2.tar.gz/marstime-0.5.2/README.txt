marstime Python library
========================

This package implements the Mars24 algorithm based on the Allison and McEwan(2000) paper. Details can be found at http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/ . The package is available under the Modified BSD license. Publications using the algorithm should reference the Allison and McEwan (2000) and Allison (1997) papers where appropriate. All mistakes in this code are mine.
