def count_cycles(series, ndigits=None, nbins=None, binwidth=None):
    """
    Returns a sorted list containing pairs of cycle magnitude and count.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : array_like
        Sata series.
    ndigits : int, optional
        If `ndigits` is given the cycles will be rounded to the given number of digits before counting.
    nbins : int, optional
        If `nbins` is given the cycle count per cycle magnitude is rebinned to `nbins` bins.
    binwidth : float, optional
        If `binwidth` is given the cycle count per cycle magnitude is rebinned to bins with a width of `binwidth`.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        List of tuples with cycle magnitude and count, sorted by increasing magnitude::

            [(magn1, count1), (magn2, count2), ...]


    Notes
    -----
    One-half cycles are counted as 0.5, so the returned counts may not be whole numbers. The cycles are extracted
    from the iterable series using the extract_cycles function.

    Rebinning is not applied if specified `nbins` is larger than the original number of bins.

    `nbins` override `binwidth` if both are specified.

    Examples
    --------
    Assuming `series` is a time series array:

    >>> from qats.rainflow import count_cycles
    >>> cycles = count_cycles(series, nbins=200)

    The sorted list of tuples (pairs) may be unpacked into separate lists of magnitude and count by the command:

    >>> magnitude, count = zip(*cycles)

    You should not rebin from bins with relatively low resolution to higher resolution because that may cause
    shifting a significant amount of the cycle count to bins with a different midpoint (magnitude). This will
    not raise an error but you should avoid it.
