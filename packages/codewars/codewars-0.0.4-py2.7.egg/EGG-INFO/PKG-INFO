        # Examples
        ## Info
        
        >In the following section you will find a brief example on how to use this
        >code. This library is ment to grow over time so more examples to come... 
        >I prep my work in advance so documentation is a thing and will be present in
        >the near future. But because I'm in a early phase of the project I still have 
        >not generated my documentation. Don't let that fool you.. I try to keep 
        >my docstrings as up-to-date as possible. There are plenty of examples 
        >in the module just open the code and see where it imports anything from
        >codewars. Not only the docstrings are usefull currently but perhaps also my
        >own used tests to see if the setup works correctly. 
        >Those examples below are however parts of raw snippets of test code and might
        >not feel due to the confirm of PEP8 or flake8. Excuse mwha.
        
        
        ## Logger
        
            Example:
            ```
            from codewars.logger import Logger
            logger = Logger(appname="test", mode="DEBUG", write=False)
            logger._testLoggerClass()
            logger.info("Hello World!")
            ```
        
        >Note
        >----
        >The whole module makes use of the `Logger` class instead of the `print` method.
        
        ## BlueTooth
        
            Example:
            ```
            from codewars.bluetooth import Bluetooth
            bt = Bluetooth()  # Initialize the class, Scans once
            scan_results1 = bt.scan()  # Scan area for the default 10 seconds, this is \
            # also executed when this class initializes
            scan_results2 = bt.run_until_discovered()  # Scan until a device is found
            print("Scan results1: {}".format(scan_results1))
            print("Scan results2: {}".format(scan_results2))
            ```
