Description: Htmlizing IETF Text Documents
        =============================
        
        This module contains one single function, ```markup(text)``` which adds HTML markup
        to what is assumed to be an IETF document (usually an Internet-Draft_ or an RFC_)::
        
          from rfc2html import markup
          with open('rfc3344.txt') as file:
              text = file.read()
          html = markup(text)
        
        As a historic artifact of being a document series which was started at the time when the easiest
        way of distributing a 'Request For Comments' was to type it up on a typewriter and mimeographing_
        it, RFCs and Internet-Drafts have traditionally been published as plaintext documents with a
        maximum line length of 72 characters.
        
        This format isn't particularly appropriate in a web-centric world, howerver, so starting in
        2002, `Henrik Levkowetz`_ started using scripts to convert the plaintext documents into HTML
        documents with the same look-and-feel as the plaintext originals, but with internal and external
        HTML links in order to facilitate browsing.
        
        Since 2004, the resulting documents have been made available on `tools.ietf.org`_.
        
        This module is a packaging of the htmlization code from version 1.113 of the htmlizing script.
        Earlier version of the script are available at `tools.ietf.org/tools/rfcmarkup`_

          * Now importing escape() from html instead of cgi if possible.

          * Corrected the copyright in setup.py; fixed some pyflakes issues, and added
            sys reload with defaultencoding UTF-8 under py27.
        
          * Added a tox.ini file for test runs across py27 and 3.4-3.6, and a trivial
            tests.py placeholder.
        
          * Added control character stripping.
