# Computational methods for fiber-reinforced composites

This package provides several computational models for fiber-reinforced composites (thermoplastics reiforced by glass fibers, for instance).

- Compute the 4th-order fiber orientation tensor from the 2nd-order one (using closure models)
- Compute the effective thermomechanical properties from the microstructure definition
