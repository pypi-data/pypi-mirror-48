        ### An Easy Python Wrapper for LJM to Just Take Data Already
        
        This is a package designed to make streaming data from [LabJack](https://labjack.com/) T-series devices easy.
        
        ### Device Compatibility
        
        + T7 and T7 Pro
        + T4
        
        ### Requirements
        
        + Python 3.5+
        + [LJM](https://labjack.com/support/software/installers/ljm)
        
        All other requirements will be automatically acquired by `pip`; see `requirements.txt` for a complete list of all requirements that will be automatically obtained.
        
        ### Installation
        
        You can install this package with `pip` through our `PyPi` package with the command
        ```bash
        pip install labjackcontroller
        ```
        
        Alternatively, since we use `pbr` in `setup.py`, you can install from this github repository with
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/university-of-southern-maine-physics/labjack-controller.git
        cd labjack-controller
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ### Sample Usage
        
        Multiple demonstrations of library functions are located in the `demos` folder, and you can [read the library documentation here.](https://labjack-controller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) However, getting started with full streaming is as easy as
        
        ```python
        from labjackcontroller.labtools import LabjackReader
        
        duration = 10  # seconds
        frequency = 100  # sampling rate in Hz
        channels = ["AIN0"]  # read Analog Input Channel 0
        voltages = [10.0] # i.e. input voltages in range -10 to +10 volts
        
        # Instantiate a LabjackReader
        with LabjackReader("T7") as my_lj:
            my_lj.collect_data(channels, voltages, duration, frequency)
        
            # Get all data recorded as a 2D Numpy array
            my_data = my_lj.to_array()
        ```
